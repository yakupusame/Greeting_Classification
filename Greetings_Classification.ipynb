              "'Just to set the scene... I have a fairly tall husband who likes to complain on long flights when his legs are hurting him. In the past we have been lucky in getting the seat next to the exits with the extra legroom on scheduled flights on a few occasions. I recall getting these seats when we asked politely at the check in desk. Ideally, we would love to get these seats when we travel to Bangkok (economy) - although I know there is no guarantee and after reading posts they can be allocated to passengers with \\'elite\\' status etc I believe these seats are only assigned by the airport check in staff on the day (or at least this is what I thought I read on the Emirates website). We have selected the next best seats for us through the online booking manager system. My question is therefore this -We already have allocated seats, so as far as I can see the only extra thing that online check-in offers is that you don\\'t have to have your boarding pass printed at the check-in desk. Things that are putting me off are: (1) I\\'ve noticed over the past couple of years that because now most people are checking in online, the queues for the online check-in desks are often actually longer than the queues for people who haven\\'t checked in online (2) Last year we had a 12 hour flight delay - the original plane had a problem and the airline then split passengers into two groups and people who had NOT checked in online were flown out on a much earlier plane than those who had checked in online - goodness knows why.My family is flying from Hartford Ct to Honolulu in a couple weeks. We have two short stops before we make it to the west coast. The stops do not allow us enough time to grab a bite to eat. Other than buying the food for purchase on the flights,I knew United did not have seat back TVs or a decent AVOD system so need some suggestions to keep my boy entertained. He will sleep for some of the flight as it leaves Sydney at 4pm. I was thinking of buying a portable DVD but battery life will get me 2 movies maximum. Same battery life problem if i was to get Ipod touch or even with laptop. So what other suggestions do you have for me?Hello,  In the fall we had a two week vacation to Europe, involved four United flights. First got canceled, ergo the second one we missed. Took three other ones instead. On the trip back two flights were planned. Both got canceled even though they were confirmed about three times. Had to take another airline back, skipped last flight and took the train back instead. Had paid for the overseas flight extra for economy plus seats and of course didn\\'t get them since the flight got canceled and we flew with another carrier. Paid $700 for travel insurance, didn\\'t see a penny. Thanks, UndineHi, Last month I booked a ticket for my wife and I to Las Vegas travelling on US Airways from Israel to LV. My passport is US, and hers is Israeli. I booked her ticket under the name shown on her Passport and Visa, we\\'ll use Jane Doe.However, shortly after booking the ticket So  But Speedbird recently linked me to an AA wikie, which linked to the Flyertalk forum, where I read about XPlats not getting upgraded on certain routes. Plus we were on a direct which was only going to be 5 stickers instead of the usual 7 for that connecting routing...so we figured we had no chance. Checking the website the night before (well within our 24 hr. window...still nothing). But Won\\'t get anymore free stickers until we fly 10,000 (which will definitely happen this year), but yeah, it was sure nice. I\\'m almost happy I figured we had no chance because it was such a nice surprise.i fly with china airlines from Los angeles to taipei with connecting flight to jakarta almost 20 hours flight. it was a very dissapointed experience from my 20 years flying experience. i\\'m a travel addict, i will travel at least 2 times a year to all over the world, n i ve been used many airlines, from asian airlines, european, even from arabian airlines..but china airlines is the biggest dissapointment. their ground staff are mean..never smile, no cooperation at all..i\\'ve never seen someone in service business that never give a smile...even starbuck who sell a cup of coffee give a smile everytime they serve. i travel with two small childrens, i asked her nicely that, if possible can she gave me a four in a row seats so we can be seating together..she respond NO without looking or even try to look for the seats..so in the end i\\'ve to beg other passangers on the aircraft so we can be seated together and the stewardess do not bother to help me out with this. and after all my documents finished and i received my boarding passes , i said thank you to her but she didn\\'t respond or look at me..just pretend to be busy. at the boarding gate they call for a traveller with a small children to be onboard before the rest, so like i usually do ,i came forward and show them my ticket and my children but alas they rejected me at the gate and said what they mean is children under 2 years old. what is wrong with this peoples, what is the differences between 2 years old and 4 years old children ? so that\\'s it ! this will be my last flight with china airlines.. i call my travel agent and said to them not to offer me this airlines again, better offer me a twin otter plane from some village airlines than this so called four star airlines...they do not deserve it bought a ticket from israel to usa which cost a-l-o-t of money.since I\\'m from israel I\\'m not familiar with there coin (GBP) or something like that, it looks just like the Euro sign so i was sure i was paying in Euro. a few min after i realized it was not Euro so it means i paid 1000 more (nis) than i thought, i tried to find an email to contect them right away to cancel my flight befot the confirmation of the ticket, but there was no email in the web just phone number in Europe that i cant call. i sent them a massage on facebook which was my only option, beggin them to get back to me..in the mean time i sent an email to paypal asking to not aprove the charge...no one was answering me.... just the next day edreams answered to my facebbok, that i can\\'t cancel the flight and there\\'s nothing to do. in there website they wrote black on white the you can cancel the flight for 25 GBP... the only answer i got from them was trough facebook, and i was begging for an email adresss i could contact and explain, or at least get a better explaintion...but nothing i dont mind paying the fee cuse anyway if ill book a diffrent flight+ the fee it will be cheaper than what i paid in edreams! it\\'s not even the gratest flight there are stops in the middle so i could find a cheaper flight for shore, it was an onest mistake that i was reading the sign wrong, i tried to cancel a less then 5 min after, but nothing... now I\\'m crying every time i remember this, I\\'m a student that can\\'t afford this amount for a flying ticket.. i need to work 3 months for this kind of amount..my all vacation rouin...Daughter has narrowed her Las Vegas trip down to 2 options. One is with US Airways from Manchester via Philly with a 2 hour layover and the other is with United via Newark with a 5 hour layover.  She will be flying mid June.We are considering flying Malaga to Barcelona in late October...  (nothing unusual--toiletries, clothes, a few books and magazines, and maybe a few souvenirs.) If we do decide to fly, my wife and I plan to have one checked bag total for the two of us and carry on bags as follows: Wife – purse and a small tote-bag Husband – Portable laptop computer and a small tote bag.am looking to I am arriving at 8:35 pm and the RGN flight is at 9:50pm. I am worried about the connection times for me and the luggage in Hong Kong. No other direct flights to RGN for another 24 hours and this trip is already long so any advice is welcome. One element is that Dragon Air is a Cathay affiliate and they are all Oneworld. Flying business class up to HKG if that makes any difference. I had to buy the Dragonair part separately as the cost was prohibitive with AA when it was part of the original ticket.Hi! I\\'ve heard horrid stories abt flight cancellation, delays, poor service, bad air plane conditions etc. We\\'ll be taking a 6 hr flight from SFO to MCO (Orlando), with 3 kids. Appreciate the feedback. thks v much!!Hi, can anyone help. I have never travelled before, or checked in online. If you don\\'t have your boarding pass its £60 for a re-issue at the airport so don\\'t want that to happen. Tried customer services but can never get through. ThanksWe are looking to book LGW to CLT soon. We have flown US Airways to JAX several times recently which involved a change at CLT.  Crazy or what? Looks like Delta instead.i am having a problem finding web sites that have multi city flights. thanksThe reason of this email is to explain an unfortunate situation, me and other 10 passengers suffered at the Denpasar Airport on the 19 of December 2015. We arrived at the Denpasar airport, 19 of December 2015 with the flight VA65 from Sydney. Virgin. Now, we went to the transit Area in Denpasar and ask for Qatar Airways assistance. Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight. Passengers in transit should not pay the 200.000 rp. So, for the above stated, and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money, I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice. Another point to have in mind, right now I am at the Denpasar airport again, as a transit passenger, I arrived from Doha with Qatar airways and I am connecting to Sydey with Virgin. Virgin personnel was waiting for us on the transit counter of the airport of Denpasar, we did the check in and we did not pay for anything. So Virgin did his part on this situation, and Qatar did not.Hi everyone, A quick question - we have booked through BA to travel to Bali, via Changi. We\\'re flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore, but our connecting flight is on Jetstar, and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi (12 hours), we would like to make use of the transit hotel. However, as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali, we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one. As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags, but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because check-in for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesn\\'t open until several hours after our flight from London arrives. If anyone could put my mind at rest I\\'d be most grateful - thank you!I have been a Life Member of Qantas Club for years but generally, these days, choose other airlines. For all the smoke and mirrors, Qantas is very ho-hum , ergo, dull and boring. After a series of serious in-flight incidents, the proud kangaroo has had a bit of PR disaster. While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer\\'s! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, QantasThe benifits of the Premier Cabin are several: *Dedicated check in (no waiting). *Complimentry drinks. *More leg room. *First on (and off) at your destination. THATS it.... You are told you will get a choice of meals; (chicken OR beef is the choice). Your luggage has Priority Hold labels fitted: (they mean nothing). Extra film channels: (the whole plane got them). When returning to the UK (G/Gow) my baggage ends up at Manchester. The Premier Cabin has 49 seats @ £300 per return trp which equals £14700, A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY FOR THOMAS COOK.... Then when you try to get in touch with them to talk about your grievances, they dont want to know, as they have your money and dont seem to care about customer service.. After nearly 2 weeks I am still waiting a response to several emails to them. CONCLUSION: Go on holiday with ANY ONE BUT THOMAS COOK.......We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn\\'t have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.Hey, I\\'m going to Japan on the 24th of June for 5 weeks to summer school and I have stopovers in Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Seoul in South Korea before finally arriving in Japan. I\\'m only staying for around 2-3 hours during my stopovers and won\\'t be leaving the airports. My airlines are KLM (for the flight to Amsterdam) and Korean Air (to Seoul and Japan), and I only have one reservation number and paid for my whole trip on Expedia so I think my flights are all on one boarding pass but I\\'m not sure. Thank you in advance!Hi there Mainly would like to know if they have personal and if so,  Looks like the The route is SYD to BKK to HEL to VIE and vice versa. Many thanksI flew to Stockholm with Finnair 3 weeks ago; on arriving after 8pm I found my baggage damaged but no one around to report it to. On flying back to London a few days later I went to report the damage to a Finnair employee in Stockholm; I was told that she couldn\\'t do anything & to report it in Helsinki where I would get my connecting flight back to London; speaking to the Finnair employee In Helsinki I was told as I didn\\'t have my case with me as it had been automatically transferred to the connecting flight that she couldn\\'t help me & to report the damage in London when I had my case; back in London I am then informed by the 3rd Finnair employee that I had been given the wrong information & that it should have been dealt with in Stockholm; I was then told to speak to the baggage people at Heathrow who gave me an information sheet to email the company who deals with Finnair\\'s damaged luggage with the photos & luggage tag; I subsequently didn\\'t hear from them so I called up to be told they couldn\\'t help me & to call Finnair customer services. After speaking to the 4th Finnair employee I am told to fill in the feedback form; that was almost 2 weeks ago; I have not heard anything or been asked for anymore information. I will be flying again soon so any help is most appreciated!My Christmas gift to my parents is that I\\'m flying them from the US to Germany to visit me this summer. However, which are quite expensive now due to rising fuel costs.  Also I\\'ve yet to hear any good stories about any travel insurance company so any personal experiences would be much appreciated. Thank you! Posted at 09:09 AM/ET, Jan 10, 2008 in International carriers, USATodayHi, Someone paid a deposit of $100 on my behalf without me agreeing to it and now At the risk of being hung drawn & quartered for saying this, I have to say, after our first flight with RA, we were impressed. Flew with RA to Malaga 3 wks ago, no luggage issues, very clean aircraft, comfy seats, good leg room & friendly FAs. Yes we read & re-read the T & Cs just in case & even took our own luggage scales ready for battle but no problems whatsoever. Return flight from Barcelona with BMI Baby a couple of days ago (also our first trip with them)on a less than clean, rather rickety plane not as impressive. Sorry to praise RA but I thought, in the interests of fairness I had to praise where praise due.Hi, I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn\\'t recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there\\'s no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can\\'t afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it\\'s extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I\\'m not sure why I didn\\'t ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There\\'s no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don\\'t know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights.  Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015I am trying to fly from YWG (Winnipeg) to Delhi in August and recently discovered that there is a direct flight from YYZ (Toronto) by Air India everyday that would get us into Delhi before 15:00h., which is awesome! I would love to take 2 flights instead of the 3 flights I thought we would have to take (YWG-YYZ- somewhere in Europe - DEL). The problem is the Air India flight NEVER shows up on ANY online search engine travel site like expedia, travelocity etc etc etc.....why not???i don\\'t get it? is the only way i can book this is to go to a travel agent?? JoI fly a lot for biz and pleasure and just got back from London to New York last week after connecting from Spain. I have never been on a more unpleasant flight. I was in economy class. A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this. Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior\\'s very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents.Hi.  I travelled from Luton last year and their lounge allows you to serve your own drinks. I prefer this way. I am travelling from Gatwick on the 6th Feb 2014 Flown Singapore, Qantas, Cathay in the past with no negatives so do not want any surprises here cheers Happy TravelerHey all, I`m after a bit of advice from seasoned travellers. We don`t travel much but I think they had a sale around June last year?? If not I can just book with AA but would prefer direct if possible, but not for an extra £250 pp! Any help or advice much appreciated. know that one should never go back and check the prices after a fare has been purchased but I did and saw that the fare had dropped by $250 since I booked the flights yesterday,Funds should be re-deposited into my account within 7/10 days ! Good to know !I was researching 1 way fairs between jfk and London on kayak.but operated by British airways for 590.But when I check the same flights on any other site it was over 1400.they are all direct flights.i usually only use kayak for reaearch.have never booked with them.Thank youI\\'m booking a last minute flight from Vancouver to Dublin for Christmas day and I basically have just US carriers to choose from, as anything on an airline I like is double the price. SoI will not be checking baggage so it does not matter if the airline charges for bags.We\\'re travelling on a family holiday to the US in three weeks and I have only just realised that as someone born in the US I must enter on a valid US passport. (last time 6 years ago, I was advised to take both but travel on my UK one and was never asked for my US one) very The Embassy can\\'t tell me this and have advised I wait until 3 days before travel before even contacting their emergency line. I\\'m despairing and we\\'re all frantic!Dear Air France and fellow passengers,. The service I have received by them in the last 24h has been absolutely appalling. After a cancelled flight I was made to wait for almost 4 hours to be attended, at which time any options for rebooking has already left or were full. Hence my morning meeting on 23/11 will be missed, and my prepaid car rental at MIA is lost. I reschedule meetings for 4pm on 23/11 assuming a 12:25 landing. After waking up at 5am I arrive at the airport to find that my 8:30am flight had become a 10:20am flight (no email or courtesy call from AF). So another meeting to reschedule last minute and perhaps lost business. Additionally the upgrade to premium economy I was promised.....no longer the case today! This is the absolute worst treatment by an airline I have ever received and I intent to pursue my rights as a passenger according to EC261/2004 or other applicable regulations to ensure my losses and expenses are reimbursed. Yours sincerely, Bob VandedrinkHi there, we are considering  The flight stops in Frankfurt on the way. I\\'ve seen some negative reviews. The price comes up in euros but it is still a good deal. Thank youHello, I am ready to book my flight to Dubai and Thanks for your help! -----As a regular traveller, I am used to the usual airport customs/immigration lines at airports. That is why I was so glad to hear Pres Obama himself proclaiming the wonderful advances in passenger processing at DFW for US Citz plus anyone travelling with ESTA. Therefore 3 booths out of 28 were open. 1hr later they opened 16 more. Yes, there were 6 international flights landing within 20 mintues of each other, but in this day and age they must surely be fully aware of the number of passengers on each flight, their nationalities and their exact arrival time - many hours in advance.

In a few months, this will be my first time traveling with it (by air).  I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed. However, I now use exclusively Clear Care, and if that does not make it through TSA, I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed. I am planning to travel to an Asian destination, where there is almost no guarantee that I will be able to find the product for sale. I wear the overnight ortho-K lenses, thus I do not own a pair of prescription glasses, nor do I have any need for them.Hi all, I was wondering if you have any tips or suggestions with booking airfares over the Christmas holidays. I am ingor chances of flights dropping in price? Reading forums already posted, I will be sticking to purchasing directly from airline carriers. To many dodgy and expensive travel agencies and third parties out there.Hi - ThanksHello All!! My brother and I will be taking our first trip, of hopefully many to London in May of 2010.I have been a little trigger shy on this because I have read some not so great reviews about United...I can\\'t wait to get those tickets in our hands!!Hi Super Escapes want to charge me £68 to add 1 suitcase to the hold. So far i can`t get a clear reply or answer off either company, easyJet say add it via `manage your bookings` but i don`t have a suitable booking reference number. But i don`t want to pay £68 if i can book it via easyJet for half the price. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.After a few tense days of waiting for an outcome,I accidently entered my last name on my mother\\'s reservation to Italy and the mistake was not caught immediately. After reporting the problem via their website, I searched the internet to find all kinds of horrible results to similar situations including having to repurchase the ticket (without refund) at the current going rate. The current rate is now $500 more than it was a week ago! I would like to thank Shirley from International Reservations for her diligent persistence in helping me to correct a name error. Without her help, I would still be worrying whether TSA would allow my mother to fly with the ticket on which I incorrectly entered my last name instead of hers. Shirley was great and fixed the problem with no issue. She was polite during the entire transaction and gave me updates along the way so I would feel comfortable on hold. Thanks again for her help. Also, thank you to Dan from Internet Support for starting the correction process.With the rising cost of fuel the airline has found ways of reducing the fuel bill by reducing the weight it carries on its flights. They will be shrinking the size of its in-flight magazines from A4 to A5 size, carrying less ice on flights and believe it or not, \"encouraging\" staff to watch their weight - with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar! But Ryanair are only following in the foot steps of other airlines ... In the 1980\\'s, American Airlines claimed that they saved $40,000 by taking out one olive from every salad in first class and more recently, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions!  prefer business or premium economy, one senior with walking stick, and i know all the procedures and requests etc pertaining to the assistance. for 50 yr anniversary. am looking at the following narrowed down after research aplenty thai airlines business class melb bgk london virgin atlantic premium economy sydney hkg london british airways world traveller plus melb into london via sigpre and gulf air business class sydney bahrain london may stoppver just for 1 night each way to break the flight limos to and from airports for stopovers this will be travel sept oct 2007, and yes some airlines have released their fares for that time already. , anyone thanks much Lil xxhi all,  but  i am hoping that i can transfer internally quicker, i will have checked in online for emirates but not have a boarding pass - i have booked the 2 flights with different companies myself so it is not an airline transfer (like the one i will be doing in dubai on emirates) thanks in advance! ---My mother (who has balance issues and walks with a cane) plans to fly alone to visit relatives out of state. I know I can arrange for a wheelchair at the airport so that she won\\'t have to walk the long distance through the terminal to the gate. My problem is that I would like to accompany her to the gate and wait with her for her flight, so that if she needs to use the bathroom (which is a very frequent need for her) while waiting, I can help her get to the restroom safely.  however,The airport that she will be flying out of is LaGuardia in NYC. Thank you for your help.I travel a lot to/from Sydney and use Jetstar 6+ times a month which of course always take off and land at T2 in Sydney. So, Qantas in its wisdom (or a sign of the economic times) has closed the Qantas Club Lounge at T2. A lot of us pay $450+ per year for a Qantas Club membership - if you cant fly Qantas (because they now fly Jetstar) the lounge in T2 was well worth it. Qantas say \"oh, just use the lounge in T3\" - well, easier said than done - you have to go through security at T3 to get to the Qantas lounge (ever done that at 7am in the morning), then leave T3 and go through security again at T2. Qantas say they haven\\'t had very many complaints on this closure (have you ever tried to navigate the Qantas web site to find a complaint form?). I did then was sent an invite to join the American Express® Qantas Corporate Card program - what? Ill be happy to let Qantas know.This is what happening just now and though I would share this with you..... After a terrible frustrating week of delays, canceled flights etc, etc, traveling all over the UK and Ireland, a friend of mine is currently sitting on yet another runway. (last one was Manchester two days ago) All was well the flight was due to take off on time great everyone happy, all passengers on the plane, first flight this week to do so for my friend, but wait... Sitting waiting, waiting, waiting, for almost an hour on the plane, when Ryanair announced there would be a delay..............as they did not have a captain on board, so said capitano has been found but now its snowing and they have lost their slot and are at the end of the q. Now I know the Captain may of been stuck in snow, unable to get in but.....just  Gota love em! not to waste your time that they supposedly offer. This was their response: \"Your reservation is booked in ?V? and ?T? classes of service. At the time of our research at www.priceline.com, we were able to locate a lower fare of $(edited) per passenger. However, the classes of service were ?V? and ?T.? therefore, we must respectfully decline your request.\" I politely asked that they re-consider, sent a screenshot from Priceline\\'s website and even offered to help them find it (because it\\'s still there and very easy to locate) when I was given another copy and pasted response telling me to read their terms and conditions. I\\'ve read them several times. Dear Delta, please just remove the program all together if you don\\'t want to honor it! No one is making you have this program! Don\\'t waste our time!  Now that I\\'m researching it, I\\'ve yet to come across anyone who has been approved. I\\'ll definitely be looking at other options next time I fly, not because of the lack of a price match, but because of the awful customer service I have received. Imagine if something really went wrong and you needed something!I hope I am posting in the correct forum... if not... please pardon me. My trip is: 7/12 and 13 Venice (via Milan) 7/14-15-16 Dublin 7/17-18-19-20 London Anyway, I have had a horrible horrible time trying to find a flight from Venice to Dublin...so I have decided to train it back to Milan and take Air France 1215 at 1pm connecting at CDG with a one hour five minute layover and then continuing on at 330pm to Dublin arriving at 4:35pm. My question is... I hate CDG airport but I have no way to avoid it. However, I don\\'t want to get caught at CDG. The MXP-CDG flight arrives terminal 2F and CDG-DUB departs 2E (I might have those backwards) according to Air France\\'s website. If anybody can help me on this connection, I would appreciate it. I have traveled through CDG many times but I have always been arriving from the US and not from within Europe so I really never paid much attention. Thanks.Hi, As information for any US passport holder or future applicant. New passport fees will become effective from 13 July 2010 onward. This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date. Remember if you use a passport acceptance office (like a US post office) or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices, it\\'s the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix. If you are eligible to, and use regular US Mail for submission, it\\'s the post mark date that will govern. Note that the one of the biggest increases (expressed as percentage) is in the additional page insert fee, which goes from *free* to $82 per insert added. Here\\'s the entire new fee matrix from the DoS\\' Passport Services page: travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_5079.html If your passport is going to expire soon, will have less than 6 months validity, or you need to add extra pages, this would be an *excellent* time to do so, before the new fee matrix becomes applicable. Travel Safe,G\\'day everyone ,I\\'m sick of being charged top dollars for airtravel in this country (australia)and looking for cheap flights from melb australia to london uk but not purchasing from my departure point I recently saw flight london to melb ret for 485 pound including taxes and most are around 500to 600 pound with the improving australian dollar the air fare seem tobe more expensive aswell sowill be much appreciated some fares in this country approaching $2000 aud at the cheap end cheersIn North America recently my Air Canada flight to China was cancelled. I was issued with 2 new tickets on other airlines, in the form of Flight Interruption Manifests (FIM). Delta accepted the 1st FIM and flew me from Boston to Los Angeles. There, China Southern refused to accept the 2nd FIM, which would have allowed me to reach my final destination in Guangzhou. I\\'ve tried a couple of dummy bookings and get to the payment page none the wiser. I don\\'t want to show up and be told I need to pay more because I failed to advise them beforehand. I have emailed AA but given it\\'s now the weekend, I am hoping my fellow TAers might know. Thanks in advance.my wife and I were returning from Manchester, UK to D.C., then on to Louisville, KY. a *HUGE* storm brought down powerlines on the tracks of the UK train that was to get us to Manchester airport. We had to wind up taking a taxi, but half way there it was obvious that we would no make our flight. From the cab, I cell-phoned the only number I had - a toll-free US number. AUnited agent finally came on the line and I expalined the situ to her. Long time on hold.... Then she came back. Not only did the lady on the phone get us rescheduled on the same two flights on the following day, but there was *NO* \"change fee\" charged to us for making the changes! I was astounded! It reminded me of the \"old days\" when it was a snap to make last-minute flight changes without penalties. Anyway, hiya all im flying back from kuala lumpur via dubai to manchester the first leg to dubai im in economy class but the second leg iv upgraded useing my skywards miles to business class my question isthanks ---------Hello as a family of 4  Many thanks , -----Hi all, probably a stupid question but it will put my mind at ease. Thanks.i booked flights Belfast to sydney on jan 4th 2016. I never noticed that I fly from Belfast to gatwick but then have to get to Heathrow for my connecting flight. Any advise would be great ThanksHello all, can you help!!! Me my wife and two children,or go Iberia via Madrid. we of couse complained but the check in staff basically laughed at us,so we got the flight via madrid at much distress to my family. We had boked these seats months in advance!!ThanksHi everybody. I\\'m flying London - Madrid - Lima with Air Europa in January 2014. I\\'ve made the reservation already but since my passport will expire within 6 months of my arrival to Peru I\\'ve been told it\\'s most secure to get a new passport. That means a new passport number.  I know that with most airlines it\\'s not a problem but I can\\'t seem to find any info online regarding Air Europa. All the best, Safarikur Sjomli.Flying yesterday from Istanbul to Stockholm (TK 1795), I tried to check in on-line the day before. I was surprised that I had not requested an exit row seat, nor made any seat request, expecting to do that at check-in. The airline had no way of knowing my state of health and physical ability, apart from having flown TK three times previously in the last month, none of these flights being in an exit row. At Ataturk, I mentioned this to a supervisor, and she just handed me the boarding pass and shrugged her shoulders when I asked for an explanation. Incidentally at on-line check in I wasn\\'t able to change the seat allocation, and by the time I got to Ataturk the plane was full, so it was lucky I was able-bodied, and that my able-bodiedness was not required.Hi, Thanks for your commentsWe are flying to Orlando in 2 weeks for our last full family holiday as our eldest is oing to NZ in October to live. As it was special we paid extra to go with Thomson, as it was adverised as a Dreamliner route and then decided to go Premium to make it more special. I presume this is the 767. We have been refunded the money for the one way but it\\'s more to do with spooling my daughters dream holiday. My youngest is 8, is a big aircraft fanatic and is really upset and is now experiencing a negative before we have even set off. It may sound petty but we only booked with Thomson because of the Dreamliner and Virgin was cheaper.Hello all;  A friend of mine told me that a certain amount of seats on all flights will be $19.99 each way. Just wanted to know what time this special starts and any possible restrictions as I can\\'t find any information on their website. Happy travels all. -----Hi there, was wondering fi someone could help me out.  When I travelled to New York from Belfast on Continental there were actual plugs to use and charge my laptop but aerlingus says they do not have these. Therefore, I looked on the apple website and they claim that my laptop can be used if there is a EmPower port available but I cannot see if this plane has it? Would be really great if somone could help me out. Thanks, PatrickApologies if this seems a silly question. I\\'ve been on Ryanair many times but this is the first time I am booking a seat for someone else. There are four people travelling. Seats 1F and 1E will definitely be booked. I then need to book two others on the same row. Hope this makes sense.Hi, Because I like to be over prepared and am flying with 2 kids,Might sound silly to some but knowledge makes me less anxious.  Thank you. Edited: 1:56 am, January 04, 2016Hi ! Me and my wife are With best regards --------------- / member of Star AllianceHi, with my 70 year old mum as a birthday treatHi KIf I book tickets on the Delta website for a flight operated by Virgin it works out almost £150 cheaper than if I book via virgin Atlantic and approx £100 pounds cheaper than buying through Expedia.  I haven\\'t travelled on a code share flight since I was a child. I intend to travel premium economy if that makes any difference. Thanks AlecHi guys, I just wanna ask if someone has same problem like I do. but I can\\'t get anywhere. It repost it on google.dodo.com.au/search.html… and that\\'s it. No way to get there. Any ideas what happened? Im quite nervous, because it\\'s first time I will fly with these guys and this is not good sign. Thank youHi we re flying from malta to barcelona and then to tenerife - as no liquids r allowed in d hand luggage. i ve read u have to use a zipper bag but i cant understand how and why. maybe someone has been through that before and can help me. thanks for any info u can give me.Hi but prices at the moment are sky high when compared to what I got last February (was doing a trial booking for August this year to work out some costs) ..................this is driving me crazy!!I have a 7am flight with Easyjet on a Sunday morning in September. We will checkin on line, but i have luggage. I\\'m guessing we have to be there by 5:30am at the latest. Trying to pin down a suitable, and affordable hotel in the area. Many of the shuttles seem to leave at 6am, or have a reviews of the earlier 5:15am shuttles being late. So I got these free drink coupons in the mail from earning a free flight.. .. I really don\\'t think I\\'ll want a drink that early, but was thinkin it might be nice to have a bottle of vodka or rum to make a drink later. As much as I have flown with SWA you\\'d think I\\'d remember how people get their drinks! I have only ever ordered a pop and once I got wine.. which did come in the lil plastic cup. Thanks! On a recent trip October 2014, on the way from Madrid to Casablanca, all five of our group didn\\'t get their bag in Casablanca. The staff were very rude and unhelpful. My friends were expected to make there way out to the airport at their own expense to collect their bags! Also No help was offered with expenses during the 3 days they were without their bags. To make matters even more upsetting, on the way back to Madrid they left mine and my wife\\'s bags in Casablanca also. I recommend you google reviews/complaints about this airline before you plan your blissful holiday!starting in March 2011. Just wondering if it is best to buy a Round the World ticket or as we are not major planners, we have a rough idea of the path we will take. A bit worried if we buy a RTW ticket are we restricting ourselves..... For example Sydney to Singapore, Thailand up through Vietnam to China across to India then to Africa, up through Egypt across to do Europe, North America and then South America and home. QUESTION:Your thoughts and comments pleaseHi, Flying Birmingham-Edinburgh Oct 25th and can get outbound flight. Want to come back Oct 27th but no flights as yet. Thanks, not sure whether to book outbound as a good price. No contact us email on website just 10p per minute telephone number. Many thanks....Di xThis must be among the lowest in the world!When we flew with Air NZ they were provided but someone said they had flown long haul and not had them provided. Thanks in advance.I could not cancer my reservations but I will never fly BA ever again --------------------------------Hi I fly from Belfast City - Heathrow with BMI, then on to SFO with Continental (flight operated by Virgin Atlantic). I booked the Belfast flight and the SFO flight separately (with BMI and Continental). My question is; I think I read that the 3 airlines concerned operate a \\'code share agreement\\'??? Thanks for any advice.I paid $80.00 for flight insurance from Access America. I had flown to Hollywood, FL from NYC to be with my husband for Christmas while he visited his elderly father in the hospital. I planned to fly back after a week. Then my father-in-law died two days after Christmas. Now Access America is refusing my claim. This is outrageous. Access America refused my claim because my father-in-law\\'s death was \"either known to you or likely to happen.\" I had no idea he was going to die when he did or I wouldn\\'t have made the flight reservations in the first place. My husband and I are self-employed so one of us had to get back to the business. We couldn\\'t both stay there for the days, weeks or months he might have lasted. When he passed away it became more important for me to stay with my husband. Now Access America is telling me my only recourse is arbitration, which involves a fee and court appearance.----- ---------- NYC, NYI am from India and planning to visit Brazil for FIFA World Cup in the month of June. i have been trying many website links of the domestic flights of Brazil like TAM, GOL, Avianca, Azul and even used expedia.com to book my flights tickets from Sao Paulo to Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre to Salvador and Salvador to Sao Paulo. I could select the timings by using a translator plug-in in the browser as some websites are not in English language. And when the payment options comes, my credit card (VISA) issued from the Bank in India is not being accepted. I have created PayPal account especially for such international transactions but this account is not acceptable by any of those websites above.Thank you.hi, I\\'ve flown with thomson in premium before and loved it. Just not sure about tc? I believe the cabins are being refurbed from this may, so I\\'m just wondered about the overall experience with Thomas Cook :) We\\'ve booked the middle 3 seats right at the front of the cabin, travelling with my hubby and our littleone whos 3years, so I\\'m hoping the space and entertainment will be easier for us. Thanks for any advise Sarah On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he\\'d been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said \" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn\\'t move\" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn\\'t come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it\\'s a similar seat close by then that\\'s fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me. Regards RickTheir customer service is terrible, and deceptive.When we had to cancel a ticket, they were very unclear about the fees, and lead us to believe that we would have a $150 balance left over after canceling, when, in reality, the entirety of the balance was absorbed by fees. It left a bad taste in my mouth that they made an extra $25 on me canceling, when the end result was me being left with nothing. I would have rather been told there was no possibility of changing the ticket because of airline change fees were too high. Getting a straight answer out of their customer service was impossible.I plan to travel from Mumbai to JFK via LHR in December. The 9 and half hour BA flight from Mumbai reaches LHR at 7.10AM. I have two options from thereon. I am entitled to lounge access at LHR. I plan to fly economy.The second one will allow me to relax a bit in the lounge. However I am a bit worried that the 10.00 AM flight would likely to be more full with more passengers connecting to it. I sure like some empty seats near mine!Recently had a brilliant short visit to Saigon. Absolutely loved Vietnam. However, on arrival home, locks on 2 pieces of luggage were (quite obviously) intentionally broken. Plus everything inside was moved around. There were 6 bags altogether but only 2 were broken into. I figured it probably happened at Saigon as we checked in 2 hrs earlier but when we got home, all the luggage was out immediately. We haven\\'t yet noticed anything missing. I made a mistake of leaving few one dollar notes in there which definitely was a temptation. Dont put anything that can be \\'tempting\\' in your check in luggage even if it doesnt cost much eg. costume jewellery/ accesories. We wanted to change our original round trip from Phoenix to Columbus to a three legged trip, from Phoenix to Columbus, then Columbus to Milwaukee to Rhinelander, then Rhinelander to Milwaukee to Phoenix. Our original reservations were on Southwest. Had to call customer service to change because our departure city was different, but the agent was able to help me, and we ended up with a $100 credit. Frontier is the only airline to fly nonstop from Columbus to Milwaukee, plus the only airline to fly out of Rhinelander. The first time I checked the fare was $175. Due to circumstances beyond my control, could not book it then. Last Thursday, ready to book, fare was $458! After I recovered from my heart attack, I explored other options and booked the lowest fare I could find, Delta thru Memphis, then Frontier to Rhinelander. (Knowing we\\'d have to pay a change fee if we had to change the Delta flights) Today I get an email from Frontier that the Rhinelander flight times have changed, and wouldn\\'t you know, our flight from Memphis gets in at 4:20 and the flight to Rhinelander now leaves at 4:15! So now we have to stay overnight in Milwaukee!! Oh, and the Frontier agent\\'s first response was to cancel our flights! He didn\\'t care how we got to Land O\\'Lakes! Off the check the cost of renting a car for 10 days - and Hello everyone! My fiancé and I are traveling to Maui next May to get married. since Thanks :)So I called the call center and was told that they had no information about luggage allowance and that it would be printed on my tickets. and even worse that I selected this allowance when booking. This is crazy !!!. Many thanks Gary.We are a couple, have been together 10 years and will see each other 24/7 everyday for the 18 day trip -- so there is no need to sit next to one another on the flight :) Unless of course the seats we are in are better than the 2 window seats.Thanks!My wife and I merged our North West World Perks miles with our Delta Sky Miles accounts. Afterwards, we found out that even if you have a recent flight with NW and your miles would not expire for quite a while, the Delta expiration date does not get changed. We are now facing a very short time to use our Delta Sky Miles or we loose them. If we had known that, we would not have merged them. Just another sad case of loosing our favorite airline in a merger. We lost TWA, which for us was a great airline until American destroyed it in the merger., they are very inexpensive for a direct flight but I\\'ve never heard of them and reviews on their website are all over the place. I will fly Turkish Air the entire way.I have never been through Istanbul\\'s airport. Flying solo.Thanks-chrisTheir latest ploy of charging for baggage to be put in the hold, when the current hand baggage legislation size rules are very tight, is a bit of a cheek. Then you get the CEO pretty much admitting that he doesn\\'t want passengers sleeping on his planes so he is able to get his staff to seel them as much duty free/food/scratchcards as possible. With BA and other better quality European airliners reducing their prices, I wonder if the middle class who have embraced Ryan Air, will start being happy to pay a few quid more and fly with a bit more sophistication.I am going back to Chicago from Cochin - India. I have a ticket to Chicago from Gulf Air stopping at Baharain and London.The layover at London is 15 hours. I have a friend in London and my question is I hope anyone with a love of travel and have traveled for many years squeezed into \"the back\", can have this experience!. All you need to do is save up those Frequent Flyer miles for years and years of loyally flying the Star Alliance airlines in the narrow, crowded seats and keeping a sense of humor knowing you are doing your favorite thing, traveling to far away countries. We will probably never again be able to afford to travel this way, certainly not enough time to collect miles nor save enough money....BUT , the memory of this experience on British Airways will last until the end of our days.  I remember boarding in the back, under the tail, and walking up the aisle, and using a pillow for a tray....Ahhh, and now sleeping pods, pajamas, slippers, 5 star meals, top shelf spirits and the most polite incredible flight attendants, obviously the creme de la creme.. Now, we two \"mature\" people celebrating our 50th anniversary, know what goes on behind the curtain!.I\\'ve been comparing air-fairs and Aeroflot has always been the cheapest. I\\'ve avoided this airline for so long, because everybody I know told me to basically avoid Aeroflot unless absolutely necessary. I\\'m looking for a decent ticket for my fly between North Europe and Tokyo. The cheaper the better when it comes to price, but flight duration is more important to me. I just looked up and the fastest is with either Aeroflot or Finnair for this route. But there is a huge price difference (Aeroflot is offering one-way tickets for 1/3 of Finnair\\'s price). My dilemma is that other routs are much longer than these. I don\\'t want to have a layover in Continental Europe because that becomes a detour. But Finnair\\'s prices are more expensive than other airlines that offer flights from Europe to Tokyo. I\\'m debating if it\\'s safe to fly with Aeroflot... I\\'ve seen comments that say it\\'s not that bad any more. But then again, I hear horrific stories.Thanks!Hello! Amsterdam-Rio with KLM Boeing 777-200ER - Frankfurt-Rio with Luifthansa Airbus A340-300 - Paris-Rio with Air France Boeing 747-400 I will be travelling with 2 kids – 3.5 and 1.5 years old. Thanks in advance!Hope someone can help as murder trying to get through to Ryainair.after reading all the negative comments on Iberia, I was dreading the trip we planned . we flew from jfk to venice (madrid stop) and lisbon (madrid stop) to jfk. we left 10/19 and returned last nite 11/01. Let me say that the planes were spacious and clean, food (hard to believe) better than other airlines, and the crew on land and in the air were pleasant and helpful.Will KLM I get points but there is an extra stop in Amsterdam. I have gone on Klm before and like the flight from Toronto to Amsterdam. Austria Airlines come with the tour package.( eg Fairfx )Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 12:51:29 -0600 13 hours late , the only positive was the polite and professional Frontier counter ticket attendant hit by a wave of frustrated , tired united passengers at 4am at the Denver terminal.. Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !! She told me to have a seat , finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation !!! I have no idea what that meant , shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification !!! we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate ... c 9 then c 10 and then f 1 .... We were a party of 4 , 2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens , in the 13 hours it took , every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us , this was very stress full on them , we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday ..I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ,ND , as Fargo was not our final destination , so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well . In Denver the night shift gave us hotel voucher , not used and told use to go to www.unitedapprecition.com for additional informationJust my luck. It\\'s my Daughter\\'s 18th today. Had a meal planned to celebrate for ages now and my flight booked months ago. Blooming heck I said, or words t that effect, what am I going to do now? To top it off I forgot that they sent me a mail ages ago changing the flight to 1020 so not only have they cancelled I got up two hours early:-((((( Not blaming EZY for the horrendous snow but I tried to call customer services at 0600 and was on the phone for 30 mins before giving up. I wanted to see if I could change the flight to go to MAN then catch a train which you can\\'t seem to do online, only reschedule the flight or get a refund. Anyway I have managed to get on KLM (€220 !) but not until 2100 tonight. There was a flight at 1500 but after procrastinating about what to do and hanging on the phone to Easyjet that quickly filled up as KLM also cancelled their morning flights to and from EDI. Anyway will miss the meal but these things happen. Never had a flight cancelled before due to weather but it would have to be today of all days.At least EZY managed to let me know by text and e-mail BEFORE I left for Schiphol. By the way flgihts to Glasgow for the next few days were over €500 on KLM. I only wanted a seat not an executive jet!! Moan over ;-)Friend - ThanksI flew with Easyjet last year for the first (and last!!!) time. We actually got as far as boarding the plane when the pilot announced that he would not fly the aircraft as he had an ear ache. We were told that an alternative pilot could not be found and that we would not be flying out until the next morning. We were put up in a hotel and given a letter stating that we were entitled to 250 euros compensation each under EU legislation. On our return, I emailed EJ requesting the compensation and a refund for our first nights accomodation in Spain, which we had booked via EJ. The hotel money was refunded butI sent a letter in March requesting it and have still heard nothing. It\\'s like getting blood out of a stone!!!Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- SydneyOn today\\'s episode of air passengers do the dumbest things.... …go.com/US/… Unbelievable.Hello all Many thanks for any info. Regards DilbertPhilbertJust wondering, (hopefully!) More snow Thurs night after being walloped this week again. Hopefully it will be a glancing blow of snow and we\\'re ok.

ThanksThey have fantastic deals to Hong Kong it almost seems too good to be true!My son was going to Mexico for 6 months travelling with Delta via Atlanta. He got an ESTA which is supposed to be valid for 2 years and for stays of up to 90 days,Sorry to keep banging on about Ryanair, but now that I\\'ve started............ I was just curiousThought I was going mad the first time it happened, but it\\'s happened every time since. For instance flight to Faro from Stn on 25 May 0.01p for one person. Change it to 4 persons and it\\'s £19.99 pp!

Thanks much.We flew to Phoenix from Toronto last week. This was bar none the worst flight I have ever taken. It was tighter than any Air Transat that I\\'ve flown. The seats are so close together that even I was uncomfortable at 5 feet tall. My husband is over 6 feet and he was miserable. I fortunately was in the aisle seat but the couple occupying the middle and window had a 2 year old on their lap. I felt very sorry for them. The wife couldn\\'t even get her purse out from under the seat until we all stood up. I took out my tape measure and measured the distance from the front edge of my seat to the seat in front. It was 7 inches!!There is also no TV on Rouge so you better have an IPad or be prepared to pay $10 to rent one.I\\'ve used Opodo many times but never again.THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME £300 EACH PLUS £25. So £625. I will never ever use Opodo again - and I travel a lot. Cheaters.other than with Air Pacific, I\\'m very flexi with dates and was getting frustrated with prices so did some searching and surely it can\\'t be taxes etc as you complete the same 2 flights and with the dollar at the moment 1 for 1 it can\\'t be thatsince there is a partition between seats 7E and 7F and the next class. All seats are still open on the flight, so I could change my seats. Any feedback?I have read that Spain does not require you to have 6 month validity but I want to make sure before I book anything (it\\'s sat night so I can\\'t ring passport office lol) Thank youOn way back we fly with BA on world traveller flight on a 777i cant find it anywhere on my e ticket or on their website thanksBooking a flight UK to Philadelphia outward..... return leg is not a problem as no US immigration to navigate.

Thanks!Good Morning, i will fly to Tokyo in August with British Airways in code share with Japan Airlines.  I found a UK phone number but it would be very expansive to call it from Italy. Many thanks NikAm I allowed to do this without breaking any rules / laws for our girl & BF which would be on a Multi City which includes a trip up to Cairns , that way we are not paying 4 lots for flight & apartment ,just 2 lots for the apartment Im looking to do this to get the best deal with the Apartment as when I book with Expedia I can’t book Apartment with a Multicity booking. Then I book 2 seats from Sydney to Cairns return (on same flight as Daughter &BF) with another apartment for which the 4 of us stay in! Any thoughts if you understand my question as that way I seem to get the most economical way of the 4 of us with accommodation ThanksHello everyone,SeatGuru / SeatExpert don\\'t seem to know much...Never done a posh(ish) flight beforeHi All, Me and my fiance are getting married next month in Thailand, and areto scatter prior the the ceremony so a part of him is there with us on our special day,I am more than happy to put a small amount of his ashes in a suitable spill proof container, and pack them in my hold luggage, so was wondering if it is necessary to inform the airline, and bring all of the documentation (death certificate etc) as it will only be a very small amount in a tiny box, packed in my suitcase. Any information greatly appreciated! :-)Hello!  I know they don\\'t have anything that matches exactly.(except extra legroom seats,vip seats etc). So, my reservation has being done from a greek agency and not from me and in my ticket they gave me it says thatThis seat has not window and i would like very much to sit next to a window. So, (next to a window for example)?I booked my return date from Mexico 1 day too early through orbitz. To change with them, it\\'ll cost me almost $800. I am lucky enough to be going on a Swiss star alliance around the world starting in May, Strangely the first leg of this trip is on Cathay Pacific (not a star alliance airline) from Brisbane to Hong Kong via Cairns.  time permitting on my G.C. ????? Not sure but would like to know in advance. Many thanks.I am due to fly to with Easyjet to Berlin for 4 days with my university class. We have been told by our tutor who booked the flights that we are only allowed carry on baggage. My carry on suitcase is a hard suitcase with no outside pockets to put things like my passport, money etc in. Therefore just to put these essentials innot I travelled with BA in December from Heathrow to JFK and found it very good. I am returning in August and hoped to go again with BA but the times/prices available are not as good as with Delta. Thanks.So I just booked a trip from NYC to LA through Travelocity and since I\\'m using my foreign passport my 4 names are there (2 first names, 2 last names). I used those names for my booking exactly like that but Okay so Dear All, I am thinking about TAP Portugal or TAM Linhas Aereas. From what I have read so far on-line Aerolineas Argentinas should be best avoided for unpredictable and long delays. The punctuality is quite important for me as I need to catch another plane in Rio to go back to Europe. Thanks, LidiaI am about to book with them and am getting nervous.Hi Thanks TonyHi -  I\\'m not sure when I go through Customs/Immigrations so I\\'m not sure if this is enough time to get through and make my connecting flight.

Many Thanks, EmmaHave checked Aer Lingus too but long change over time in Dublin. ThanksOur flights have been rescheduled !! ....Our travel agent says no problem the airlines wouldn\\'t change the flight times unless it was possible. A now stressed traveller.and have changed the itinerary a number of times. We are now considering a route via USA instead Asia or the Middle East as a two day stopover each way is what we normally do to keep it a holiday and not a travelling ordeal.

British Airways then cancelled the LHR - DUS flight and rerouted me via HAM. So now I will fly LHR - HAM - NUE. This is a question out of curiosity more than anything...  Emirates is 30kg but Qantas states only 23kg. No response from either customer service yet.... Thanks in advanceNever been before so not sure of the best area to be in for visiting all the sights. ThanksJust did an online check in for my trip to Prague in a few weeks time with Jet2. Edinburgh to Prague,didn\\'t pay extra for seat and took the allocated seats for both outbound an inbound flights. both seat are 2C,which is an ailse seat near the door,so I can be last on and first off, couldn\\'t have asked for better or even paid for it. travelling solo and hand luggage only so i am a happy chappy.,good idea in my opinion.We used Orbitz for a recent flight to Mexico. We had nothing but problems from the start. It took 3 phone calls and a request for a supervisor before the problem was solved to get us to our destination. On the return flight, we arrived at the airport and we were told we were on standby! We had reservations for 3 months!!! We were not able to get on a flight and ended up renting a car to get home while others who were on the \"overbooked\" list, were offered $500 trip voucher and a hotel room.  JaneI live near Boston. in early June for the Venice Biennale. on my way home because I\\'ve never been there and I\\'ve heard wonderful things about it. An additional twist - most flights from Boston to Europe leave in the early evening and fly overnight and I usually can\\'t sleep sitting in a plane, so I\\'m thinking of booking that leg in business or first class to get a lay-flat seat for sleeping. But all the other flights can be economy-class. Thanks in advance!(since they took out the one row) or Qantas Prem Economy. Any advice suggestions would be appreciated.Thanks. There is a little foot room under the bulkheads, however, for passengers in coach row 6.Hi guys I have several United Club one-time passes left over from recent trips I have taken with them, and I was just curious as to whether I would be able to use them if I\\'m not flying with them. Example, im flying with Austrian next week out of Terminal 2 at Heathrow,  Thanks :) Thank you Jerry MehlmanHave just for a friend  I have suggested she takes another from of ID with \"Mrs\" on it to the airport with her ...Hi there  Thank youThanks!I\\'m flying to and from the States over the summer and  Thanks.I just wanted to post this in case anyone else has flight anxiety. I get very nervous on flights, and at one time, broke into full blown tears becuase I thought the plane was going down in turbulence! I went to my doctor, and she just wrote me a script for Ativan. I wanted to try to kick this fear DRUG FREE. On my Ipod, It has videos of a captain talking about different sounds, movements, and things to expect. It has demos on how planes operate, land, take off, etc as well. It also has those relaxation tracks on it. (a guy speaking sllllooowly and telling you everything is going to be fiiiinnne.) I listened to it on my last flight the whole way, and the 2 weeks leading up to it. By no means do I love flying now, but I can tolerate it, and I\\'m not anxious and fearful. I encourage anyone with the same feelings that I did to check it out!Thanx.Getting ready to book our annual business class trip from Miami to Rome. which was also great.(Leaving an overnight for connecting on a separate ticket) Now.......  in the past with very mixed results...once pretty good and once with awful service .....and this year have the option of booking them nonstop from Miami.Have checked Airlinequality but did not see anything recent and would rather pay a little extra for BA or Virgin if Alitalia service has not improved. I know the opinions of Alitalia, justifiably so, have not been positive on this forum but am hoping that there might be signs of improvement.Hi which means it will have 4 months left before it expires. I know that I can get into Australia as the passport just needs to be valid for the duration of my stay (2 weeks) but Thanks ------I have read a few articles saying they are having one fixed price for all year round, so would bring the price down in high seasonHi  I\\'m feeling really anxious about getting my connecting flight. Thank youHi,  Anyone know? on the day of your flight, regardless of flight time. I like to spend time in the departure lounge, just people watching and chilling out before my flight, last time we flew with First Choice we were able to check in 5 hours before flight, I know that is some peoples nightmare but It\\'s all part of the holiday for me ;-p Been to LCCT a number of times but never to KLIA.I know its a 20 minute taxi to LCCT and considering if I should just take carry-on on the first flight (I usually travel light and can probably shove stuff in carry-on). I\\'ve booked a seat towards the front for a quick exit :) It\\'s no biggie if I miss the connecting flight.Hi, as the online guide is still showing September/October. Many thanksBad publicity=results Great news!  Our flight is on Feb 1st and we have gone from a 319 to a 767 and are now on a 77L. No more rouge!! at least not on the YYZ-BGI route (for some flights) I haven\\'t done a lot of checking but I noticed equipment changes from early Dec. to end of Feb. for now. If you have a flight in that time period, check your seats. We haven\\'t been notified yet but I did see that our seats are not blocked out and I can\\'t change seats online. Guess that\\'s a call to Air Canada. To those of you who helped us get Air Canada\\'s attention by expressing our displeasure through CBC, CTA and the Competition Bureau as well as here and Flyertalk ... Thank you!Thanks I\\'m so worried about fitting my stuff in the overhead compartment since they don\\'t have underseat storage in first class.Hi, on this weekend, i went last nov with 30kg baggage for economy, now  Thank you- My plans are (were) to travel to and from Spain on both dates. Typically information here in the UK is not readily available with the media rather concentrate on a pretend politicians speech. I am also aware of potential baggage handler strikes...not so worried about them.Even First class is just regular old leather seats they have stateside, not I have just paid a fortune to treat my wife on a super trip. TaHey Jus a quick quetion  ThanksHi there,  and chose the LowFare option, with no extras. Just the basic cost. I then realised the dates clashed with work plans, This cost me a business class upgrade on my next flight. I contacted them they deny it, I went through the process again and kept recods of the booking process and id does not warn you. EVA say they tell Ebookers that they have to warn customers, they don\\'t if they are then it is hidden and I can\\'t find it. In essence they are conning people so be warned. The response from Ebookers and EVA was totally poor. I am now flying Emirates again and will never use Ebookers again. They are not ABTA bonded either I found out as a result of this so again BE WARNED.-----.My husband and I are planning a trip to Amsterdam and Paris in Sept 2013. We can be flexible with our dates and we were thinking of traveling after Labor Day. We plan to book roundtrip tickets on the Thalys train to travel between the 2 cities. We appreciate any input that those experienced travelers can provide Thanks.. I\\'m guessing this is to start aligning the fleets with Continental. Thanks.Hi  Thanks!I need to be able to lie down during the flight. I am a UK national thanksHi there. As we all know, regularly airlines have offers of companionfares from/to certain destinations, such as book 2 and pay 1 or book 2 and one gets 50 pct discount....etc.  I\\'ve never seen a bookingengine come up with these fares, as these searchengines are not programmed to list them in a query. Maybe someone has other resources to search for these offers? Thanks very much for your replies WikiHi everyone, I booked a separate seat for my infant (15-month-old), and I\\'m confused about the baggage allowance. Thank you.They stopped flying out of Kona days before our flight. They did not contact us and when we got to the airport we found a phone at their counter and were told we were pretty much out of luck. They had not made alternate arrangements, nor could they help. We did not have the credit card we\\'d used for purchase and were told to call when we got home and they\\'d refund our money. We specifically asked if we needed to do anything else and were told all we needed was the credit card. Now that we\\'re home they\\'re saying we need to return the paper tickets that the other person was wrong. I find if ludicrous that they strand us and then try to shift responsibility to us for their mistake. We don\\'t have the tickets, so we\\'re supposed to talk to corporate. We\\'ve left messages 3 times now and no one is calling back. The only phone number on the website is to reservations and they will send a message, that goes unanswered.  Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Without the board I think I would have waited and maybe payed simular or more, but with stop overs and not on such a nice air plane.I,ve just been looking at a package with Jet2 over xmas/new year to Servigroup Venus where we have stayed many times. I got the price back and had a quick chat with hubby and we decided to go for it and book. I,m so angry, I had a live web chat with their advisors who more or less said it boils down to supply and demand on flight seats and hotel rooms. I don,t buy that, not in such a short space of time. Well I,m sorry Jet2, you can stick it !!!!! Edited: 9:38 pm, August 04, 2014British Airways has refused to reimburse us (wife and I) for expenses we incurred due to their cancellation of our flight. They offered $150 travel voucher each. Our costs are $470.44. We arrived at LHR at 10AM on May 24, 2013. BA advised that all flights were now canceled until 4PM. That meant our 3PM flight to CPH was canceled. We stood in line at BA Customer Service for ten hours, along with hundreds of others. Customer Service only opened 4 windows. As the hours crawled by - tempers flared. We got to the window at 8PM. No flights available this day, nor the next day - that would get us to CPH in time for the evening sailing of our cruise ship. We agreed to an 10AM standby for CPH, and a alternative code share routing that would get us close to the port where the ship would be on the second sailing day. We spent the night wandering Heathrow Airport, and retrieved our checked luggage. Not much sleep. Next morning - no luck at Standby. Rushed to the alternate plan - and flew up to Manchester UK. Then - rushed to another terminal to partner Lufthanza for a flight to Munich Germany. From there, Lufthanza toHamburg - where we arrived at midnight of May 25 - on a weekend night - without a hotel reservation. Taxied to a hotel (very lucky) and got a few hours sleep. May 26 - off to the train station: took train to Rostock, them S-bahn to Warnemunde. Hurray - that is where our cruise ship was now docked. We made it - No Thanks to British Airways - to whom we had submitted all our documentation. And - to be clear about all this: We are requesting Nothing for the Ten hours we futilely stood in line, for the stress and aggravation, for the no sleep, no food at the Heathrow airport. Back in October I purchased a R/T ticket on KLM web for a trip in March 2014 to Entebbe, Uganda. As part of the ticket I paid the fee for Economy Comfort seat for 4 legs (JFK-AMS, AMS-EBB, EBB-AMS, AMS-ATL). Since October I\\'ve routinely checked my itinerary online and up until yesterday everything was in order. Yesterday I looked at the seat map and the flights appear to be very full. I\\'m concerned that if my seats have been re-sold or given away, I will be out of luck. It\\'s not about getting a refund if that happens, I really want those seats. 24 hours of flying is tough but the KLM Economy Comfort product makes the trip much more pleasant.We followed all the guidelines and wrote requesting compensation for the 4 hour delay. Thomsons declined stating it was extra ordinary circumstances. Basically the flight from Majorca was delayed because the flight into majorca was delayed due to ongoing planned roundworks near to the airport causing \"some staff and passengers to be late for the outgoing flight\". These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staff/passengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time. The flight was also n a Sunday evening so this should have not been as much of a problem as it would have been at peak traffic times. After they declined my daughter wrote to the Spanish aviation authority and they agreed and advised compensation should be paid to the amount of é400 per passenger. Thomsons still refused and have refused to answer any further communication. She did all the communication via the online form - should we send in one last letter by post or should we proceed to the small claims court and in our opinions do you think she has a good chance of succeeding with the compensation claim.I\\'m currently looking to Both and while AA is slightly cheaper, I was just wondering if it was worth the saving? Basically, . Any advice would be appreciated.I wasn\\'t sure what forfum to post this to so i hope I can get an answer here. I believe there is a site, maybe google, where.... Well let me say what i am looking for. I am going to 5 countries in Europe. I was hoping to look up things to do, restaurants, etc and plot them on a map for myself. There are a lot of preset things with peoples suggestions on the net but would be cool if i had just the stuff on there that I wanted so i can plot out my days.ThanksOn arrival at the airport she was told she needed an Esta form before she could book in. As she was only in transit at Washington airport and not leaving the terminal she was not aware she needed one. Please be aware that you will not be allowed to travel without one. She did eventually obtain an Esta number from the internet site and just managed to catch he flight but it was very stressful and time consuming. She had a connecting flight from Washington to Ottawa with a two hour time span. Please be aware this is not enough time to negotiate customs and immigration and get to your next boarding gate if you are travelling through Dulles airport. Luckily the Wasington to Ottawa flight was delayed or she would have had to spend the night in the airport. They also lost her luggage!!! Hi,  I\\'ve booked a flight to the UK next year and have seen some complaints about the removal of foot rests in Emirates planes and uncomfortable seating on long haul flights. I\\'d like to hear the experience of anyone who has flown with Emirates recently, thanks SueNO Economy Plus at reservation... only on day of departure. So that means they are trying to sell the seats to one time fliers instead of reserving for those who have almost 50k miles. Also, taking away one bag at check-in. But Hi guys i really need them.waiting to hear from you.Hi there I booked a holiday through Thomascook.com for my wife and I to fly to Kenya in October. This was scheduled to be flying with Monarch Airlines.  Having looked at the Monarch Airlines website - all passengers flying to Mombasa are allowed a baggage allowance of 35kg PER PASSENGER. If you booked Premium Class this went up to 45kg PER PASSENGER!! I\\'ve been in touch with them and they refuse to budge! I\\'ve since cancelled my holiday with them and booked through Cosmos and got exactly the deal I was after..... 3 weeks in Kenya to look forward to, and 45kg of luggage each. This will enable us to take extra clothing to distribute among the local population as we did in 2005. Dave HillI booked a flight with Travelbag online website, and entered full payment details, only to receive an email response that \"Your reservation arrangements are now being finalised and you will be contacted by a consultant, either by email or by telephone, within the next 72 hours to confirm your arrangements.\". Ridiculous to wait for a flight booking for 3 days, prices change every day, its either confirmed or you book somewhere else. There is nothing in the booking process that suggests this will be the case, though on later inspection there is something embedded in the T&Cs. I emailed and also tried to call the support line to find they are only open 11am to 5pm. Called the next morning and got bumped to a voicemail. Still waiting for an email or call back for a conformation or refund.  Its quick, no waiting butI reckon its just another form of fund raising!-currently in Palma Spain and have unofficially been told they may have to wait till Monday for a return flight - Recently, I was on a full flight. Various nationalities were represented, and an American couple was giving the flight attendant a really hard time about nearby passengers \"who smelled bad\". They had angled their air vents toward said passengers, thus in turn causing them to complain. Despite American\\'s culture of bathing, deodorant and perfumes, I once read that North Americans smell bad to Asians. Who knew? Manners, odors, demeanors, all are culturally different and possible offenses. So I learned something new.  In the end, we are all responsible for our own comfort.Just curious...I was a little surprised as it seems so far in advance (more than 24 hours) I would think they would get another crew. (I don\\'t think he is happy coming home so late at night before a work day but they wouldn\\'t let him change to the earlier flight. Not much anyone can do, really.)Hi all. I\\'m trying to plan a trip to Exuma. The only problem is my husband will go wherever I book, his only request/demands are it has to be a non stop flight and he requires business class . We live on Long Island and My travel dates are flexible so no worries there. I\\'m even willing to drive to a different airport other than jfk if necessary (within reason).  Thanks in advance for any suggestions :)We are flying into T4 with Malaysian at the start of the evening rush hour and would like to rest for an hour or so before crossing London.  (We also noted that most seemed to be open mornings only, presumably for passengers off the \"red eye\" needing to recoever.) It seems easier to take a break at Heathrow than to try and find a refuge at Paddington until the tube clears.I recently flew with Thomson and would never do so again. I flew with one checked bag at a meagre 20kg, and my usual hand luggage bag on wheels. All was perfectly fine on the way OUT (hand luggage was given a cursory glance and declared to be fine), but coming home was a different story. The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight. I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before, even on the Thomson flight out. I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold. I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this, pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag. Upon reaching the desk, I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed. I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small hand-luggage sized bag, of....wait for it....€133! The staff were rude, dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks. This obviously only applies on your return flight, where you have no other option of leaving stuff, and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood. I felt bullied and was reduced to tears. During discussion, I was told my flight was completely full - it was not. I was also told if I didn\\'t pay up, the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk! (really?!) There were other people queuing, all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only. I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson, and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes, thus saving myself €133.  PS credit to the amazing cabin crew staff who looked after me on the return flight - i could have hugged you all for your kindness.I\\'ve been reading reviews over the net about HA and PAL. Hawaiian Air has way cheaper airfares for MNL-SFO, but at the same time I\\'ve been reading on some negative reviews from people who took Coach(economy) flights w/ them. As for PAL, their airfares are way up, although I have had no bad experience when flying w/ them. Its the price difference that\\'s making me think of trying HA\\'s service.Thanks!Long story short have fallen for a girl who lives near Seattle, WA and with the exorbitant price of flights to and from the US really I need help getting there. Tickets for an 18 hour connecting flight with a stop-off in Pennsylvania on comparison sites come out as £500 which is just ridiculous considering and Icelandair who do fly from Reykjavík for a well priced direct flight pose the problem of getting out to Reykjavík and getting home from Reykjavíc.  I\\'m not an experienced flyer but can get to pretty much any airport in the UK if it saves me some money. Thanks. Edited: 12:09 pm, March 05, 2014 Last year I booked rather late and the prices where much more reasonable than I\\'m seeing right now. Michael PS I\\'m traveling from Seattle to Austin TxHi! This fall, we\\'re flying on Air France from Los Angeles to Barcelona (connecting at CDG) then returning a few weeks later out of Venice to Los Angeles (connecting at CDG). While I understand that most flights within Europe do not allow you to pre-select your seats, We were able to select seats for the international portion of our return trip but not the outbound. Can anyone help me figure this out, please? It is our honeymoon and we\\'ve purchased Premium Economy tickets. We\\'re really hoping to sit together...and not in the middle of the 4-seat row. Thank you for your advice!Hi, They seem to have the flights to Tenerife, Fuerteventura etc. on sale already but none to Lanzarote from Cork. Thanks :)Here is a copy of a letter I sent Cheapoair. I am trying to have the police in New York file criminal charges. They say I have a credit for $1833, but won\\'t let me use it. 8/29/07 I am a physician working in Walnut Creek California. I bought (11/ 6/2006) three United Airline tickets ($1833 visa receipt is attached) from Cheapoair (internet site located in New York) to fly from San Francisco to Cancun on January 20th, 2007. Due to changes at my job, I cancelled my flights well in advance of the departure date. I was told I would now have a monetary credit (minus a $100 penalty per ticket) that could be used for one year. I called and reconfirmed this numerous times. I have been trying to make new reservations for over three months now. At first I tried to use the credit to go to New York (see emails), now I have been simply trying to rebook my original itinerary (SFO to CUN). Every representative tells me I have a credit for $1833, and that they can make me a reservation, but when I go to book the flights they say they have to talk with their booking department and will get back to me. They never do! I have cell phone record of hours of conversation time. I have also sent numerous emails, including a final warning that I would be filing a criminal complaint. —both promised repeatly they would get back to me, and never did. Sincerely,Any domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair, operating under the British Airways banner. BA/Comair has a “policy” (it happened on both of my flights) of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding, as “the cabin is full”. Don’t do it. I did, and had a phone stolen from my bag. When the crew approached me at the door, I asked them if they would stow the bag on board, meaning in the cabin. They said they would. Instead, I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables (minus one) from the carousel in the terminal. To add insult to injury, my bag was well within the regulation size, it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker (on the return trip) and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway. When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checked-in luggage! Had I not been so sleep deprived after a long international flight I might have been more circumspect when ambushed by the crew. BA/Comair has not responded to any of the three emails I have sent them. So much for me being accommodating. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we\\'ve taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes.I am traveling from 09-08-2016 from Schiphol Amsterdam to Hong Kong till 15-08-2016 and will visit Shanghai till 20-08-2016.

Greetings, ----- & ------- E-mail: ----------------------Hey all I\\'ve only just started watching the internal flights and the next cheapest is $100 more. I\\'m only asking as wondering should I wait till after Christmas. I haven\\'t been monitoring the flights and will jump on it if it\\'s good. Thanks very much.Flew AMS to ALC yesterday. After take off I kept hearing a high pitched squeal/yelping noise coming from below my seat. Now I didn\\'t have a very hot curry the night before so knew it was not me. I began to think there was something wrong with the plane. Airbus 319\\'s can sometimes make strange noises. Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely. Turns out that they You wouldn\\'t think a little dog could squeal so loud. It wasn\\'t really a bark, more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time. Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out. Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat. He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making, perhaps he was immune.

Very interesting. Hey Guys, i\\'m thinking of flying with them later this year from Australia to the UK and just after some general feedback on the airline. Thanks in advance!!I travel on Firefly (the \"budget\" airline under Malaysian Airlines) for the convenience of flying out of Subang Airport. Recently, I opted for the \\'taxi\\' booking to add on to my travel booking from the Firefly website. Let me tell you - NEVER opt for this. The airlines charged me MYR6 and it is really for no good reason and it was not explained clearly in the website. I was under the impression that \"for my convenience\" I could book a cab to get to the airport and this was the cab fare. It is not. It is merely to have the cab company call you to ask whether you need a cab!!! Which you can do for free on your own. So, in addition to the MYR6 you pay to the airlines, you will need to fork out the metered fare plus MYR10 (because you booked the cab as opposed to flagging it down at a cab stand). Do not get cheated by Firefly by opting for this \"taxi service\". We were going to book WT+ and we have enough BA miles to upgrade to Club World for one leg of the journey. When I last checked about a month ago most dates were available but we wanted to hang on a few weeks to spread out payments (flight to Chicago just booked and paid for) so held fire and were about to book when the news came through regarding the changes. Just wondering --- Same with binoculars- We are planning on viewing a space shuttle launch and want our binoculars with us. Must I check them in to.

Many thanks.I\\'m taking my first trip to Europe in March, and about a month ago flights were priced at $ 817 from to TPA to MAD. Now they\\'re $ 910. I think I should have booked when I first looked. My question for all of you who travel from the States to Europe frequently is: I know they could also rise, but I\\'m not sure what a normal price would be. I know it\\'s a crap shoot, but I\\'d like your advice on what you\\'d do. Thanks in advance for your help.Its companies like Dial-A-Flight...... I\\'ve tried them a few times to see what deal they can offer, on line it looks good, but once you phone them the deal never seems to exist. They quoted me £850 to Bangkok! Crazy, I managed it for £580 myself for Christmas time.I have recently had cause to get in touch with them to change my booking, I had to wait 35 mins for the call to be answered and at 10p per minute not a cheap call, Once I got through I was told the server was down and I would need to ring again the following following week as they don\\'t open Sunday. I rang in the week and waited 28 minutes for my call to be answered, booking changed, received invoice via email but the details were incorrect, I wrote to them and got nothing back and had to ring again on Saturday, after another 22 minute wait my call was answered, I asked for the booking to be corrected, the operator assured me all was now correct - to date I have not yet received a corrected updated e-ticket which means only one thing I have to ring again as we fly to Greece in 12 days. The thought fills me with dread!!! One thing I can be certain of it didn\\'t take them this long and this many goes to get it right when they took my booking and the payment.Because they are 14 and 17 and they need tons of food and get hungry very easily. and I feel like paying $100 for this service is just too much, I mean the airport is super easy to get around and there are signs everywhere, they have traveled a lot so they are very familiar with the transiting process.  this should be an optional option for parents that don\\'t trust their kids...- I\\'m sceptical until they get any A380s?Hi Is one better than the other. Which one can travel the farthest?ThanksI have booked a weeks holiday with on the beach and they have informed me I need to check in on line prior to travelling.

When I began the online check in, as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct. I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email. Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online. As the hotel was booked, we had little choice but to pay the £110. Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears. I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance. Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page. I believe this is what happened to us. It also appears their terms of contract may be considered unfair. So I intend to sue them in the county court and Hi all.

Hi I usually travel with Easyjet so am used to filling in the information on their website. Where can I fill it in if travelling with Ryanair? I have heard that you now add all the details when checking in online instead of having a separate page to fill in whenever you like. However, I thought that API was required at least 48 hours before the flight time, yet Ryanair allow you to check in up to 4 hours before the flight leaves, so how does this work? Is there a well-hidden API option somewhere that I have missed? Many thanks in advanceI am booked on SWISS Airlines from Rome to Zurich in Economy.

Looks like I have to rush to disembark from the plane and run to embark on the next plane.. They make their money on extra charges that are not necessary.

Thanks in advanceAfter reading up on the Internet and been unreliably informed by our travel agent that our names being transposed on our etickets i.e first name as your surname and last name as your first name we decided that it should not be a problem. Turned up to check in and were not able to be checked in on a virgin flight to bali from auckland. Apparently Virgin cannot alter the booking only the travel agent (who is of course was closed at 4am) can. The only option was to purchase another ticket!! We made it in the end but our ticket home has the same problem!!so trying to sort that now. Hi Folks Icurrentlywhere I intend to do stop-overs on the way there and back. Current best option by far is Austrian Airlines to Tokyo via Vienna. However which leaves very little room - having never been to Vienna airport or flown with Austrian AirlinesThere is an alternative earlier flight to Vienna but unfortunately it\\'s at 6am which means no sleep, an expensive transfer to the airport and a 4 hour wait at Vienna which significantly lengthens the flight. So no a very attractive alternative all round! Any thoughts appreciated.We\\'re of to Oz next December. Some friends of ours are hoping to come too but Thanks!I have flown direct via Aer Lingus, but am curious about flying Boston-London-Shannon. but so far I have only done 3 of the minimum 4 BA metal flights required to requalify, my flights having been mostly on AA.

I have horrible nerve pain in my feet, and typically need to apply frozen gel packs that wrap around them with velcro straps about every 2 hours so I can walk.

Some of these flights contain legs flown by separate airlines.Would love to hear from you if you have - airlines, days of travel, must see sights in Melbourne, etc. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!Will be travelling from Australia to the US/Canada in December and the best price I can get for 3 Adults is on Cathay Pacific, obviously via Hong Kong.

Basically :-)Just curious... We flew with them before xmas and had a good selection of movies and was looking forward to new ones as published in their magazine and on the Web site but alas the same ones. Didnt get our reserved seats and as a family of four were seperated. Staff were rude and abrupt. Didnt like giving out drinks and had to keep asking for water. Web site was poor and wouldnt let us choose nut free meals. 2 out of 10.We have prebooked our seats, butAnd you are paying for it. It bears no resemblance to their adverts. If they were a bank then their would be mismanagement companies after them. Worse still got return flight at 21:30 so will be starved by we get to Manchester.Positive is great cabin crew and comfortable seats(in extra leg room) will fly with them again but never buy meals in advanceThe reason for not flying direct is based on price and lack of availability. The outbound journey would allow us 2 hrs 5 mins to get the connecting flight in Dublin, and the inbound journey would allow us 1hr 55 mins to get the connecting flight in Belfast International. We will have hand luggage only.Thanks in advance. Edited: 8:55 am, January 08, 2015We had no problems arrived for checked at correct time & was at the boarding gate 10mins before boarding.

Alternatives are Qatar and I have asked about them before and received great feedback, or Etihad who are currently cheapest.

The reviews didn\\'t reflect well upon the carrier, and just want to get some feedback from anyone traveling them out of CVG. Thanks in advance!The reality here, of course, is that there really is nothing unbusiness-like or underhanded, nor are there any \"bait and switch\" tactics in what these sites offer or what they charge as YOU authorize the total amount of charges which you agree to pay when you \"submit.\" It isn\\'t worth complaining if YOUdon\\'t exercise reasonable care -- and READ THE FINE PRINT beforehand -- when using such sites. One thing to always be sure of is that you see a physical address for a legitmate place of business and someone whom you can contact should a problem arise.

We are planning a trip to Brisbane in July and August 2015 and I am wondering whether to buy the tickets now or to wait until a few months closer to the date. Current prices are round about £1300 which seems incredibly high. We are fairly flexible on dates, as long as they are in the school summer holidays. Most of the advice I can find (eg internet and talking to an agent) suggests buying now.

We were traveling with 4 bags all of which had TSA locks. On our return trip we cleared customs in Miami and re-checked our bags in for our flight home. When we got home all but one on the TSA locks had been removed and not replaced. One of the removed locks we found inside one of the bags. The remaining 3 locks (One case has 2 compartments to lock) are gone. Nothing appears to be missing except the locks, but Hi I could do with a bit of guidance please, iv just got back off holiday (3 day break to Lanzarote). I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up. My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away (personal reasons). I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for! this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them. Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didn\\'t book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them. I\\'ve had two bad experiences on my trip to and from Vegas to Portland. Didn\\'t really pay attention to the air carrier when booked ( kind of figured service was close to the same through out the industry, everyone is hungry right?). I\\'m not sure if every flight through spirit is late, but both of mine were! 2hrs late leaving PDX (sat their for over 5hrs), and now I\\'m sitting here writing this in the Vegas terminal where I have already been for 3hrs and will be for at least another 2 at this point. It\\'s very frustrating and extremely unprofessional in my mind. I don\\'t know how big this company\\'s pockets are but if problems like this are persistent then I\\'m not sure it really matters, they\\'ll dry up eventually.Hi, thanks for your commentsWe have booked a thomson flight (flight only).

We are flying Manchester to Las Vegas.I\\'ve posted a few questions on here about getting through a particular airport. I like to over-prepare and know exactly where I\\'m going. So far I haven\\'t had much luck in getting exact answers. So here\\'s the thing: I take a bus from the plane to the terminal, and have to somehow find my way to my next gate. I look at maps and still don\\'t know what way to go. I\\'m sure I\\'ll figure it out when I get there, but I know that until then I\\'ll worry. I\\'m trying not to stress over this, but I am anyway. going insane and/or getting lost and So i know this was a HUGE thread last year,and probably still ongoing,but I didnt want to hijack it 80 pages in.... My flight last night from JFK-FRA on Lufthansa was PACKED,and I guess a lot of people had their seats screwed up(so the pilot said as we were taxiing to the runway). I was on an aisle of a 4 seat section,and the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wife,who was in the row ahead of us,in a middle seat. I declined,as I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyer(i dont show it,but I do need aisle access) and i reserved my seat 2 months ago. The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c \"he needed to stand.\" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy. Lufthansa was fine,though,service was good despite the passengers. We had in seat entertainment,decent food,plenty of beverage service and free alcohol. Anyway,feedback is appreciated. ------. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,I can plug in a multiflight in Kyak and get a price listing mutiple carriers. I can also just do th LAX to Paris and Florence to PAris and get a price, and use ryan air from Paris to Rome. Just wanting input on what others did, what they found most conveniant and less expensive. I am not flying till OCtober,so I think the prices are coming out a bit high right now. Will purchase closer to July/August. I am leaning towards using Kyak and doing the mutileg just so I dont have to mess with booking ryanair. I appreciate any input.Has anyone had any experience with Flighthub.com?Do not use www.Flighthub.com. I have been on the phone for 2.5 hours trying to reschedule a flight. Two agents that flat out lied. The first agent (Kay) had me on hold for over an hour then never returned. Total wait time 1 hour 15 minutes. Second agent (Lloyd) said he changed the reservation and updated the itinerary and would email it to me. Total wait time 45 minutes. He emailed the cancelled intinerary and did not save the new updated itinerary. Third agent (so frustrated I forgot her name). She states that there is no reservation and only 2 of the 5 new flights are in the notes. She states that they could not make the reservation and that I should call back on Monday for reservations. Total wait time 30 minutes. If I did not have a $1372.20 credit.....oh by the way, I had to pay $700 in cancellation fees to use the credit, I would never ever use them again.Both my layovers are less than 24 hours and I don\\'t intend to leave the airport.

I realise that the days of cheap international air fares are probably over (especially from Australia) but I\\'m also getting a little desperate for a holiday. My travel dates are flexible but I can\\'t find any sites that will let me ask for air fares over a date range (except Air NZ that will show prices across a week). Any thoughts or am a being a bit hopeful?was 45 minutes late taking off from Memphis because they were \"still loading baggage.\" We arrived in Las Vegas 1 hour past Arrival time. As we landed, the announcement was made to lower all window shades & place seat belts in seats, as the plane was scheduled to depart again quickly. Waited 45 minutes @ Baggage Claim. No bags. Passengers flooded Allegiant Office, where it was \"determined\" that the baggage was not in LAS, nor was it in MEM. & No there\\'s not another flight from MEM today. Maybe tomorrow? By the time most had spent 20 minutes filling out Lost Luggage Forms, I (not one to give up easily) asked an Allegiant Associate if they were sure they had checked all possible cargo areas? @ This point, I\\'m thinking:: \"Surely they didn\\'t put a whole flight\\'s luggage on a plane to ???\" That would make no sense. It HAS to be HERE!!! She made a phone call:: \"Has anyone checked the middle cargo compartment?\" Held for a few minutes. Then \"Yaaaaaaay!!!!\" Duh . . . 1 more hour before we could retrieve it from the belt. So 2 hours 45 minutes of wasted gambling time. Bet I could have lost @ least $245 by now 😜 You would think they would at least hand out Free Drink Tickets, as we were all dry / parched / & way overdue for 1st cocktail. No. I didn\\'t even hear \"I\\'m sorry for your trouble / wait / delay / stress.\"I\\'d really like some help with this, if I could, please... I\\'m looking at  Initial research seems to reveal that the EK suites are more private with sliding doors and the QF suites are more open.

We were notified yesterday about a schedule change for the last leg of our flight.It looks as if Continental may charge us $75 each if we do. Thanks for any advice you can offer us!Hey all, I have a flight coming up on Wednesday and did not pay close attention to my transfer flight. I am flying from Des Moines, IA to Atlanta, GA to Los Angeles, CA. Unfortunately  or should I expect to have to change it somewhere along my journey? Thanks!We have a few options at the moment in booking a Melbourne to London flight for Dec/Jan this year. Etihad had the best return fares but have disappeared at the moment, with the next best being Malaysian, followed closely by BA and Cathay Pacific. For single flights, we can get the same prices, flying over with Singapore and returning with Etihad, BA, or Qantas. The costs for the two one-way fares is pretty similar to the return fares. Up until today I was pretty sure we would go with the one way fares, mainly because Singapore has such a good name and we could then try (mixed reviews) Etihad on the way home, or Qantas if we wanted the old faithful. What changed today was that Cathay has come into the game with a very competitive return fare and I have heard that they are on a par with Singapore. If this is right, it would seem that taking the Cathay return fare would be the best option. Thanks. ----In September this year. My new husband and I will be travelling to the riviera maya in Mexico for our honeymoon. We fly from Manchester to cancun with thomsons in premium seating. I\\'ve probably worried myself needlessly.... However I\\'ve been reading reviews on Thomsons long haul flights on skytrax and seatplans websites. I`m not sure whether one is available (if there is one on the TAP airlines website it is very hard to find) but Their website only seems to offer a time for a flight if you put in a day you want to travel, what I want a timetable with all the flights so we can easily see which destinations have flights at reasonable times and on days we can get off work. I`ve got flight timetables for other airlines we`ve used, or intend to use, why don`t TAP do one ? Or make it more easily \"findable\" if they publish one ! I have flown Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Blue, Pacific blue, Air Nz, Continental, Tiger Airways, Air Asia, Thai, Singapore, Vietnam Air, Bangkok Airways, Freedom Air, Emitates, British Airways, United, Emirates, Easyjet and probably a few more I can\\'t remember. Singapore would be my fave because of the amazing crew who will do abosolutly anything, nothing is too much for them. Entertainment system is top notch, with large screens, and plenty of movies, Tv, games etc, there is something for everyone! Another thing I love about SIA is the legroom. I don\\'t know the stats but even in economy I feel there is much more leg room than other carriers. And finally the food. Sia by far IMO has the best food of an airline. Second for me goes to Emirates with Thai a close 3rd. What are your favourite airlines I put this link up on the Orlando forum, but I guess it worth doing here as well. I pack and ship my stuff via FedEx or UPS all the time for vacation trips. It doesn\\'t work for business trip and shipping anything like a laptop would be rather risky, more for what\\'s on it than the laptop itself which can be insured - The contents can\\'t! usxp.com/products_and_services/… There are other services available and many folks who want to have their own skis or golf clubs have been using them for sometime. Just google \\'luggage delivery service\\'. You can also check sites like Travel&Liesure and Travel&Holiday for more resources. I like traveling \\'luggage free\\', but it only works for non-perishables, and when you\\'ll be arriving at a responsible destination, like a good hotel/resort or villa rental. Just a suggestion. It may destress some of the travel restrictions - except the laptop one!According to www.seatguru.com AA 763s come in two different first class seat configurations: The 767-300 ver. 1 (763) has regular seats. The 767-300 ver. 2 (763) has lie-flat seats. (besides calling the airline and debating the point with a rep on the phone...) If I am going to pay for first class, I want to be sure that I\\'m getting a comfortable seat!Just wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this. Two different groups applied for their Esta\\'s. An email was received to say Authorised after the initial word on application said Pending. We could not book in online, it came up as check in at airport. We were directed to different desks around the airport, the final one being the Special Assistance desk. There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us. We were told there was a problem with our Esta. We promptly got the Esta number up on our mobile devices but the check in staff said it was too late to book 9 people in and closed the flight!!! We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets! There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us. The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us. After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day. Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4. 4 going first via Newark, then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston. They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughter\\'s friend flying with our other family members. We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning. We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children. Tap would not help us with a hotel, meals, nothing! We have a case open with the CAA but at this point TAP are saying we did not have the correct documents. We did have them and produced them, there was no-one to help us at Heathrow. We had no different documents on the Sunday when we were allowed to fly with United.TIA ---My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA\\'s Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered \\'beyond reasonable\\' and it would be \\'unfair to other customers\\' to make an exception. (via a response from the airline\\'s Twitter account!)They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ---- I wasn\\'t able to pre-book our seats together and now am wondering about how other things are going to go. I also wasn\\'t able to find anything on the forums (unless they are part of the old XL Airways). We got pretty cheap tickets and now am wondering if we are going to get what we paid for. Any input?Hi. This was a disaster for me because on the 26th I am meeting up with my sister who lives in Sydney, before she flies back on the 27th. I haven\\'t seen her since 2008. I informed Silkair of the problem and they asked if I wanted a refund. I immediately said yes and then rebooked with Air Asia to land in Singapore on the 27th. But then said they could re-route me via KL on the 27th, so I told them I had already booked the other tickets and asked for a refund. They then It was their decision to change the dates of the flights.I have just booked my vacation with Liberty Travel for a trip to Cancun. Frontier had the best prices for a nonstop flight. Now I am reading a ton of bad reviews. Im nervous :-(I booked a round trip ticket (w/ 5 days in between departures) for 360.00 USD on virgin air. I heard wonderful things: \"Its modern\" \"Everyone is so friendly\" \"Free wifi\" \"great in flight entertainment\" \" Electrical outlets at every seat!\" I was sold! I thought I got a great deal ( never flown to nyc before and 360.00 seems like a steal) But now, im a little nervous. Maybe I\\'ve been reading too many reviews by \\'difficult passangers\\' but I have heard : There is only free wifi on flights from sfo to jfk, all others must bay 13.00 usd most outlets don\\'t work ( was a common complaint I\\'ve heard..) no free inflight drinks or snacks ( not even water?) inflight movies and ther entertainment are available for an undisclosed fee. Now, im not by any means a difficult passanger. I pay attention during the safety lecture, bring my own food and drinks as well as a book or two and most of all, I realize the flight attendants are there for safety and not to be a \\'sky waitress\\' But after reading/ hearing all that I can\\'t help but feel like I got a bad deal. I adore jetblue and I feel like I should have booked with them, I could have had a free cold drink mid flight and some basic cable incase I tire of reading.  I worry that she may not want to board with out me or she may have a hard time navigating the rows alone. Im really just looking for some real experiences from agreeable passengers who have flown VA and, to see if I got the great deal I thought I did. Thanks for your help. ( and honesty!)EasyJet have announced they will close their base in Madrid this October, pulling all eight aircraft out and redeploying them elsewhere across Europe. Although only 20% of services will be lost within the next year, EasyJet are still selling tickets as normal through the winter season with no route or frequency cuts at all other than Manchester and schedules still show early morning departures and late night arrivals in Madrid, which shows that aircraft is based there. Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they won\\'t happen but others less so will not? I\\'d say for the time being people DO NOT BOOK EASYJET FLIGHTS TO/FROM MADRID POST OCTOBER 2012 AS THERE\\'S A CHANCE IT MAY NOT FLY! Give it a couple of weeks or so unless anything happens before hand. Anybody remember when they closed East Midlands flights? They sold them and people were booking them when EasyJet knew they wouldn\\'t fly at that time. Same seems to be happening here! Edited: 4:17 am, June 23, 2012The flight time changed, but Orbitz didn\\'t notify us, I just happened to check the Alitalia website the day before. That wasn\\'t a big drama, but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service. The real problem started at the airport, we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers. I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a) I was at the airport trying to check in b) No, i didn\\'t want to cancel my booking and c) I am Australian, so my zip code has only 4 digits, we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around $250 before check-in close. Since the flight, I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue, with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email, who just say to call. When I call, I\\'m repeatedly put on hold (paying international call rates) and was told on the last call that \"Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline re-accommodated us on a later flight.\" They do not read my emails or listen to what I have to say (ie. we only got on the later flight after we purchased new tickets), just keep repeating the line that the airline put on a later flight. I\\'m sure we have some rights under the Montreal Convention but it\\'s hard to make any claims when you get no response from the airline or incoherent, useless responses from the agent!I have an upcoming trip that is on a US Airways ticket, but one of the flight segments is on UA metal. I change from US to UA at SFO; the airlines are in different terminals. I am familiar with this airport but have never had to travel between terminals before. I couldn\\'t find this specific info anywhere online. My connection time is about an hour and 20 minutes so I am not too worried, but just would like to know what to expect ahead of time.Some of you may remember my post from last year: tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k64972… The thread appears to have been frozen, however I resurrect it now to give you an update ... Until last week I hadn\\'t flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread, but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing ... Once again, the staff were polite and professional - but this time I was prepared! My regular \"explosive\" solution was in my checked luggage, and in my hand luggage said shouldn\\'t test positive - and they were right. It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me.  (apart from once in Bilbao, when they suspected it was something totally different - but that\\'s another story ...),  in their hand luggage - they seem to be on the lookout for it (I was assured I was simply chosen at random, though I\\'m sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the X-ray machine ...). For clarification, the solution that tested positive was Specsavers\\' Easyvision Allpurpose solution; the \"safe\" solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose. If anyone needs a 100ml bottle, they have a stock in Specsavers in Queen Street Cardiff ;-)Im due to fly out of gatwick to las vegas in just over three weeks, ie if they have premium economy seats left, they might aswell \"use up\" my points and let me upgrade, any help or experience of similar scenarios would be appreciated cheers!Hello, Thanks!they charged me $672.00 because i had to change my flight from one day to another. when i complained, they gave me back a whopping $150.00. steer clear of this company, please!Can leave anytime. This was my first flight, so I did a lot of research.  Our flight was on time, we arrived early, and had no problems. LBE is a small airport and very easy to navigate.We were delayed 22hours last week and were late arriving at Male. We are both airline crew so were wise to the excuses they gave. They basically blamed snow, Spanish ATC and fog at Gatwick, all of which were lies! The airline were most unhelpful and had no reps at any point during the delay and lied to us about the reason for the heavy delay. Thomson couldn\\'t even send a rep the next day to the Gatwick Hilton hotel with details of our departure time and on our return we should have been given a letter stating a technical problem for the delay not all the lies originally given. Despite asking for an address to write to for compensation via the rep in the Maldives she failed to give us a letter on why the delay happened, which we were entitled to and had to get a copy of this via a kind passenger. Because of the dishonesty and the fact they were spineless to confront their passengers we won\\'t be using them again. This was by far the worst service I have received from any company and ruined a truly amazing holiday. I\\'m trying to fly from moline il to daytona beach. This is outrageous an my vacation isn\\'t till may an they have jumped $500 I can fly to Mexico for cheaper than that what\\'s the deal hereIt\\'s years since we have flown can anyone adviseUsing first choice just need peace of mindI had not been singled out for one of those random security checks where they go through everything in your carry on and person for a very very long time. Until last month that is. I believe the last time I was selected was several years ago. Last month my flt was cancelled and my airline (UAL) switched me to a Delta flt. I had to retreive my bag, change terminals,check in with Delta and go through security a 2nd time. We ordered train tickets over the phone for a specified time (12:45pm) and got on the trian only to find out that we were given the wrong boarding passes (2:45pm). We noticed this after a request to show our tickets half-way enroute to London. The conductor on that train was so rude and didn\\'t listen to any of our complaints and ended up slapping us in the face with a fine of 101 British pounds ($190) each with my travel compainion. Our efforts to discuss the matter with Virgin trains were turned away. On the same car another lady had the same problem but was welcomed with police at the train station in Euston because she failed to pay the fine. Please write me back on allen.63@netzero.com Back in the U.S I run out of luck with limited help from the Headquaters of Virgin Atlantic in CT. Thanks in advance.Most airlines seem to mention that you can have a carry-on and a personal item but it\\'s not mentioned here. My husband usually brings his scuba regulator as his personal item and we\\'ve never had an issue with other airlines. The checked baggage allowance is more than we need but we don\\'t like checking our regulators in case they get they get jostled too much and don\\'t work. I checked mine once and had problems with it on the first dive so haven\\'t checked it again since. I will be arriving from London at 9am and then connecting to LAX at 10:30am. Air France OK\\'d it saying 55 minutes is the minimum connection time, but really, so you think 1.5 hours is sufficient? Thanks!DH and I are in Israel for 2-3 years and our goal is to see as much of the world as possible in our lifetimes.please! Ideally, these are 4 hour or less flights since many of these trips will be long weekends.It\\'s hard to find detailed information on hotel websites, and I can see from some tripadvisor reviews that some hotels only have hourly shuttle services (in which case it\\'s probably worth getting a taxi for early morning flights, and I\\'ll price that in when making my choice). Last time I had a 1 night stopover the hotel only operated a small minivan to get to JFK in the early morning (despite using a bigger vehicle the night before), and we had to wait over 10 minutes for the driver to try to squeeze all the passengers and luggage on, with some luggage/passengers ending up on other people\\'s laps, and some left behind.We\\'re looking to book a packaged vacation for May 1st out of Vancouver,  -eckHi, So not the main photo page but the observation page opposite. Apart from that the passport is perfectMy bag with the things I need to stay busy I need access to! They won\\'t put it up top will they if it doesn\\'t fit? I just read this, and since I bought a new bag, that does not completely close, just snaps, if someone puts it in the overhead things could fall out., I am going to be really upset. Its a long flight and I will have some snacks and things to read. This trip was cancelled due to my wife taking ill. SLK but never booked a flight there. Hi!  So the transit time will be 2 hours.Please give me the advice.(which your going on) I\\'m flying from Chicago to Dubai in June and would like to know as it is a long flight.Thanks.they are by far the cheapest, probably half price, but some of the previous reviews are not so good, feedback would be appreciated.Like many other passengers I got fooled... I booked a Madrid to Casablanca flight departing at 13:00 When I got to Madrid airport I was told the flight was at 18:50... I Had to wait for more than 6 hours at the airport But not only this, I can\\'t seem to find any information on Sunwing and how large the seats are. Are they simular to Skyservice (Skysquish) or more like Air Transat and WestJet, or more generous like Air Canada? I am just trying to get a sense whether members of my party may require the seatbelt extenders, or if we are better off booking with another airline. Past experience has been that the seatbelt extenders were only required on SkyService, but no issues with economy class in the other airlines. Thank you!The Harrisburg to Newark flight has been canceled for the last two day and there are no other flights that would get me to Newark in time for our international flight. I am worried that if I cancel my flight myself they might also cancel my international seat. I do have trip insurance through Expedia. Thank you for your advice, I am an infrequent flier.hi, (Not ER)(as per my ticket)which looks more like a business class seat along with a minibar. (I do hope that my flight is a refurbished one since the old style is no different from a business class offered by other ek aircraft)Hi everyone.  Thanks.- only have two days. I cannot find a flight (besides easy jet0 that has a direct flight to barcelona so I thought I could take the train to a neighboring city nand fly direct.

I\\'ll email them both myself and ask what the score is with checked luggage howeverI have this horrible vision of arriving in Sydney and waiting at the luggage caroousel whilst my luggage is sitting very lonely on a carousel in Gatwick!!! Eeeek!Question to all the experts out there. I do have a flexible ticket backup with Virgin but want to cancel that tomorrow if it\\'s safe to! ThanksAirlines are being ordered to pay compensation for long flight delays and claims can go back 6 years . I had a nightmare delay in June 2011 but cannot claim as i have very few details of the flight . The flight was a Thomson late night flight from Malaga to London (Gatwick I think ) in mid June 2011. When we got to the airport we were told the flight was subject to a long delay so we were taken to a hotel in Torremolinos for an overnight stay . The flight was delayed until the next afternoon . Does this ring a bell with anyone ???? Any help would be much appreciated ThanksAre travellers aware that in booking a package with Expedia that, in the case of Air France, luggage charges will be added to the fare at the check in desk, and you will be asked for immediate payment before being allowed to board? We recently returned from a trip to Florence, having booked a hotel and flights deal. On arriving at the desk, we were charged in excess of an extra £100 \\'baggage charges\\'. Of course, Expedia will no doubt point out that they do say (in quite small print) that \\'the airline may make extra charges\\'. Such a pity that these nasty little surprises await us to add to the already stressful event that air travel has become, driven by the grubby and petty greed of formerly honourable companies. Read everything, no matter how small the print - NEVER trust a travel firm, \\'tourist\\' has for some time meant \\'sucker\\'. PMHi, I have booked a flight to JFK from Manchester with Lufthansa. The flight will go from Manchester to Frankfurt and then connect on to another flight to JFK.ThanksHaving trawled various sites we may be looking for something which is not available but if anyone can provide info it would be appreciated. This is fine for all the main bits of cover but only covers missed intl flights from and to UK.or is it simply just make sure you don\\'t miss a flight and/or hope the airline is accommodating if fates conspire against you. Happy New Year and thanks. Mike.She wasn\\'t sure why there was a delay.he flight is from new orleans to venice marco polo with plenty of time between stops in frankfurt and vienna. No fees like Expedia which charges $9.99. Many of these airlines give too tight times between the layovers, you need at least 2 hours for the passport control and to catch your flight. Hi, Hi I know all about charges for baggage changes in policy (fees) next year so that does not need to be addressed on this question.Thanks Edited: 5:25 am, November 30, 2014 I\\'ve looked in March and May and it doesn\\'t show up on the United website or Expedia.im getting a bit worried about the flight after reading some of the postings! with there being 5 of us upgrading to premier class isnt really an option it adds up to quite a lot of money!! Hi Boise to Bangkok cost $921 per person round trip. all flight\\'s on time no baggage lost. I got upgraded to economy plus on 3 out of 4 international flight legs for no charge. meals were OK .service staff were pleasant. watched 8 movies i hadn\\'t seen before. for me a typical boreing uneventful experience LOL but that is what I expect when I fly. I researched and made sure I flew on 777\\'s not the old 747. the 777\\'s have seat back screens. Our travel agent, and the airlines state this is a \\'legal\\' connection, and there is no other connecting flight later that night. I am concerned that this is a legal connection for a 25- year- old that can run, but I am nudging 70 and my fastest pace is slow. Am I being needlessly concerned? Any advice is appreciated - thank you.HI  when you enter USA . you go thru immigration to see if they will allow you entry. then you go thru customs where they look for contrabane. You do not go thru TSA. You only encounter TSA if you have an ownward domestic flight. when you leave USA or have a domestic flight then you go thru TSA security.

Though I am still scared of flying that airline based on what colleagues at work say but this is a great thing they did The DW pointed me to this info and she liked it so I thought I would share this on the Air Travel forum 1) We left over 2 hours late both going to and departing Hawaii. No staff members were informing the travellers about any delays. 2) Food was extremely poor especially for the cost of $25 per person per flight. Going to Hawaii we only had one choice for each meal: Dinner : Small size Chicken and Rice, Salad and a small chocolate . Breakfast: A meat pie (Yes, that is right) for breakfast and a ice cream bar. Not my idea of a breakfast meal at 3am. 3) The flight crew were nearly invisible, mostly talking to each other for the flight, as our rubbish stayed infront of us for atleast 1-1.5 hours. 4) In flight entertainment - was not handed out until at least 2 hour into the flight.Hello ,after i oredered the tickets i saw all the bad reviews here ( Too late :( ) y now in the begining we both got a mail said that there is a problem with the credit, after half an hour i got another mail that my payment is confirmed but my friend still waiting for the mail. thank you very much for reading I\\'m flying into Germany in a couple of weeks and at the moment the long range forecast are saying heavy snow.We\\'re flying Manchester to Vegas and haven\\'t flown with then for long time.

Thanks NicoleThis shows up in Expedia as a business class, but I can\\'t tell by looking at the description on Virgin Atlantic if it really is or more like eg united\\'s economy plus which is the same coach seat but with a few inches more room. ThanksTrying to decide which airline. Quatar is shorter and cheaper, but am concerned with issues in middle east. Singapore avoids the area, but is much longer and slightly more expensive. I\\'ve heard great things about Singapore and know nothing about Qatar air. Please helpHey, I posted a while ago about flights going to orlando in September with aerlingus from Dublin, there was a bug with website but it\\'s fixed now :) The flight dates I want have just came out today (3rd to 17th sep) on the site but I don\\'t know if it\\'s best to book immediately or wait (working about €800 return). I have been watching the prices around those dates and I think the prices have suddenly went up (about €80) from the other day. Not sure if I should book now (to avoid further hikes) or wait Thanks for any advice :)Hi  - our plans are flying into jfk staying in New York 3 nights . Then we fly to San Franscisco for 3 nights then back to jfk where we fly to Jamaica for a week then back to jfk where we fly straight out again to home (the uk ) .I\\'m flying from Dublin to chicago in a few days and need to carry my laptop and tablet with me, my handbag isn\\'t big enough for my laptop to fit into,ThanksWe had never used them before & got to LAX for a flight to Las Vegas only to find out it had been cancelled. Even though mobile phone number was provided when booking made, I received no phone call or SMS. We were not even trandferred or wait listed on the following flight (even though I hold a gold card (emerald) for a partner airline). Told us we were booked on a flight 6 hours later which would have meant we would have missed our pre-booked trips in Vegas. After inquiring about car hire & how long it would take to drive - we were informed that we\\'d get there before the one were not wait listed on would have even taken off !!! After a bit more complaining the manager came out & offered t omove us across to United Airlins. I bet that hurt :-) Return flight to Hawaii was not much better either, but we\\'ll save that for another time. Spoke to Rolf Saxon at Las Vegas airport who wasflying on our flight to San Fran (on Virgin America) & even he said he would NOT fly with AA, & being an actor he is flying around alll the time !!!It also meant calling both airlines when I wanted to make a change to my itinerary and is just an all round pain. However, I didn\\'t realize that I could check both airlines for this flight until after I had booked. It may be that I could have got my flight cheaper on one if they had not sold out their allocation of lowest fare seats.Thank you.Our son lives in Atlanta and from time to time we get our grandchildren to come visit us in Florida. They have been flying in and out of Orlando on Air Tran. Now this is NOT a rant post against Air Tran but I am going to start flying them on Delta out of Melbourne. Reason being that the last two times we went to Orlando the service was so slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow that they missed the booked flight. Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time. The problem seems to be two fold. First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load. Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with. So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the \"back\" to assist you. Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne. Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time. That is NOT the case in Melbourne as they are expediant and professional at all times.- Book a plane ticket to find out 4 days later that no ticket was booked - eDREAMS - Have your credit card details entered wrongly and get a more expensive ticket 3 days later - eDREAMS - you want to wait for at least 15 minutes their customer service rep only to find out they don\\'t speak english - eDREAMS - you want to get your name misspelled and not be able to fix it becase of incompetent customer service - eDREAMS. - I\\'m an Ontario, Canada resident who is spending a little time in California before leaving to Vietnam for 3 weeks with my wife.

Thanks in advance!Currently planning my honeymoon and haveWe are spending 2 weeks in china and 1 week in thailand.This seems to be the cheapest way to get to phuket from china by flying guilin to kl to phuket with air asia.It kind of defeats the purpose of going to the airport the day before if we are going to have to stand and queue in the same queue that we would have stood in had we just taken our cases in the morning! ThanksThey say there arebut as we booked through TC I have to sort with them. I have yet to get anyone at TC who can do this as they have booked 30 seats on the flight as a group. Wondered if anyone else has succeeded in upgrading in the past? Thanks. I\\'m an AAdvantage Platinum who was really concerned about flying 15 hours to Europe and then 5 more hours to Asia with my elderly mother. The experience was nothing compared to the usual service you would receive on board a US airline. Air France provided an excellent service on-board and were completely oriented towards creating a smooth experience for my mother at the airport. We had to do this route before with Iberia and their on board service was terrible. I can only wish Air France flew from South America to the US as well. By the way, I am not French, I don\\'t speak the language, and we were flying Economy. and if you stick to the rules your ok.

Last flew there 10 years ago on Royal Brunei, and suffered leg swelling & discomfort.Thanks in advance.When I asked for my original seat they told me to take the seat I was given or they would have me removed from the plane. that I shouldn\\'t worry, asThanks a lot, United! I didn\\'t want my money back I wanted to fly comfortably. United is interested in filling and moving planes, not in serving customers. In my opinion, United\\'s skies definitely are not friendly. The folks at the desk lied to me (told me that seat 29B was economy plus) and were rude. The flight attendant at the back was insolent. And one of the United staff actually threatened me. There MUST be a better way to travel.I guess but I\\'ll give it another whack. I am not an experienced air traveller but I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn\\'t mind so much if the price drop wasn\\'t so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.Now I know the meaning of the bromide \"you get what you pay for\". allowing 4 hours me when I expressed concern that I would miss my connection for an additional GBP 200 (about $400.00 and 20 times what I paid for the original Ryanair ticket) After several attempts to contact them, I don\\'t expect them to address this issue. Never Again!cheap but not having used them before,I am trying to decide which flight to take and I have a question about layover time on a connection through Heathrow. Here are the flight details:Most of my London flights are to Gatwick so I\\'m not as familar with Heathrow.Any help is greatly appreciated!Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don\\'t tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.The items missing included (I didn\\'t have a comprehensive list of the contents): * a cordless drill (the whole thing including the case was taken not just the battery) * a bicycle light (again the whole set was removed not just the battery) * a cartridge of silicone sealant * a cartridge of adhesive * a bottle of medicines The airline has refused to take responsibility saying the items were removed by security personnel.Thanks., not because we don\\'t want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions.I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" butIf we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. Hi, we are leaving in a weekin order to \"facilitate dialogue\" with the company regarding the sale by AENA.

Source: eldia.es/tenerife/2014-08-14/6-trabajadores-…Okay, so we\\'ve got the least favourite airline and why thread, so I thought I\\'d start a favourite airline and why one. Even in economy. On one occasion I was travelling with my wedding dress and I emailed ahead just to ask how they would advise I carry it. They suggested as hand luggage, but they also very kindly arranged to have a cake and cocktails delivered to us on board. That was really lovely of them.  for that hop HRW-AKLHi I\\'ve contacted thomson twice now and I\\'ve had a different response both times.Anyone know which one is correct or have checked a car seat in for free (when only booked flight and not on a thomson package). Many thanks for your help.Hi allMany thanksHelp! for the first timeand reading reviews on  I\\'m looking for comfort and service is important too. Thanks in advance everyone! -Redenvelopeand are currently booked However, we are considering upgrading to Club Europe on the flights for an extra charge of £150 each.We don\\'t care about food served en route, what we do care about is comfort level of the seats.If so, then we\\'ll do it, if not then we\\'ll save our money. Many thanks!hi all thankyouMy daughter has been told that Has anyone experienced this one way or another when traveling on American Eagle/Executive Airlines in the Caribbean?(after calling and requesting it 4 times)after I spoke to a SupervisorAfter a week of spending at least at 3 hours altogether in trying to get through to a SUPERVISOR - I was told that I would be refunded the money in 5 WEEKS! They refused to send me a confirmation of their mistake and receipt for what I SHOULD have been charged. 5 more phone calls later, and being (what I consider now to be purposely cut off) - I am still waiting to speak to a Manager. I have tried e-mailing with no response either. , and dont expect any kind of customer service thanks for any replys dawnHi, Many thanks in advanceHi all,a UK based travel agency. They deal in multi-stop itineraries, on which special rules seem to apply. When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However,I usually write my name as \\'Luuk\\', while my passport says \\'Lucas\\'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn\\'t to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I\\'m currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. since I provided them with the correct names. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that \\'this is not a guarantee for the USA\\'. So now I\\'m getting a bit freaked. I\\'m sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Just wanted to express my annoyance,because apparently we have to drop off passengers in Jamaica, uhg!!! We lose about 1/2 a day of vacy because of this, totally annoyed.Hi,I am totally confused with the regulations at this stage! Thanks in advance! JoeWe are flying Melbourne to Paris on China Eastern in June this year (2013) with a 5 hour stopover in Shanghai. Trying to find out if there\\'s a transit lounge where we can shower and change.to help with having a quiet flight, have a window and see the alps if it was clear.our names were called out and I pointed out we had pre booked as could have the family if they had desired to sit with each other! To no avail of course as they had made their decision. I think this was rather poor of them as I thought they would have the points I have with them to give me a flight one way.Hithe prices at the moment are quite high compared to if I wanted to travel at the same time this year Many thanks AnnAirAsia has every possible fee or charge imaginable! Flying from SIN to DPS or HKT the published fare was around 155 USD but the final price I paid was 350 USD. I believe this is extremely poor and misleading practice which eventually deter many customers. Look into KLM for a cheaper and more professional approach to air travel to avoid AirAsia\\'s haggling!Just want to ask a question, hope someone can clarify...I keep getting different answers!!! Planning to go to Portugal in August to renew. Thx in advance. Best of all there is no hassel. My flight was from Pheonix to JFK, in November 2010 and it went like a breeze.Hello, as far as I know.I figure it should be in the luggage you carry inside the plane but Edited: 8:08 am, April 27, 2016I recently took a job that will have me traveling in and out of Russia once a month. I just got the itinerary for my first trip and the longer flights are with Lufthansa (the shorter trips are with United). I currently have a United FF with a few miles but nothing significant. It looks like the majority of my flights will be fare class \"T\" but only one of the flights is within Europe. I can give all the details on the flights but I don\\'t want to unnecessarily bore everyone with the details. Thanks!We\\'re thinking of using it again. We have connecting flights.Anyone know a way to do this?I was thinking of buying my husband a piece of Rimowa luggage which he loves the look of. He does a good bit of- mostly to Asia -It\\'s called a \\'cabin trolley\\' and the vendor says it\\'s legal, but I believe the limit is 45\" and this one is 46\". I can\\'t seem to find a 20\" from Rimowa. Thanks for any advice you might have.Hi all. Thanks in advance Regards Edited: 4:18 pm, June 03, 2016SoFlying straight into FLL is almost as much as the cruise it self!People have been using Stansted for years. Essex is a big county and Luton and Gatwick are a long way. Because of this, I will no longer be able to travel with TUI. If flights resume, I will be back like a shot. Otherwise farewell Ayia Napa and the crew was so friendly and very helpful The economy meal was pretty darn good, too with the gelato for dessert a surprise. We arrived on time (6 am) at terminal 2 which was a first for us who are used to the prior terminal 1 (I think or terminal 2 has had a massive face-lift). Our bags arrived unscathed from our departure at SMF. Hi all, I can\\'t find any hard case that\\'s smaller! I am definitely wanting a hard case.If not I hope they make this available soon.This seems to be common practice by Aeromexico, whatever the whatever the season, as I and others have experienced this on numerous occasions with this airline (a friend booked on the next flight had the same experience), convincing me to avoid Aeromexico at all costs. After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us. She promised to place us first on a wait list for the flight we had booked. When we appeared at the departure gate we noticed our names were numbers 18 and 22 on the electronic display of wait listed passengers. Aeromexico and its staff do not understand customer service. Avoid this airline at all costs, particularly if your arrival time is of the essence, either for a connecting flight or an important appointment. happy that Aurela are not supplying Monarch anaymore, but they have also used a Slovakian airline which also ran into to trouble a couple of months ago, with a Mayday call heard by passengers had to emergency land in France. as I am very worried now, especially being a nervous passenger and am due to fly with them to Portugal early October????Would 2 hours be enough or should we add an hour or two?Hello, , is this normal ?

ThanksThanks.Please : looking for advice/experiences with airlines offering reasonably-priced fares in a seating class higher than economy.Am claustrophobic and can\\'t do longer flights in economy. Am traveling in late May/June 2010 --destination under consideration, but likely Zurich, Frankfurt, and am open to options, as will be taking the train around Europe an can do that from many starting points.. Thank you.Sorry if this is a stupid questionas it says really............on for the next week or so,We are flying in just under two weeks andbut then I had a dreadful thought- If they do I might have a problem, since I really doubt they would take the time to roll the air out of each bag again and pack them back up lol. So I might have to cave and pay for the third checked bag if that is the case. :/ Does anyone have experience with these? Can anyone out there advise me. I have phoned two of the major operators but their advise is ambiguous to say the least. Thanks in advance. J.M.B.Possibly a very stupid question butCan anyone please advise which airline is better?I need to book flights from Manchester to Orlando. I have had a price from both airlines and there is not much difference so i am going to go with whichever is the better one.......trouble is ive never flown with either, can anyone help? Many thanksApologies if this has been asked before but I can\\'t find a straight answer anywhere. as what I\\'m travelling with is bulky but weighs nothing and won\\'t fit in one suitcase. TIADear Community I am travelling from UK to Chicago for a holiday and trying to plan a trip to Raleigh from Chicago. I know how to get good prices within Europe (through price comparison sites...etc) but not sure Travelling with a chilld. Appreciate any guide on this from US experts. ThanksHiand has anyone flown the row 5 seats? All the reviews say they are both pretty good. Thinking of upper of the way over and 5B coming backTwice recently I have flown American Airlines to the USA, out of Heathrow. The first occasion was a business trip. Worse was to come, when, a couple of weeks later I had to go back to the USA because my very dear sister-in-law had died suddenly, Security question: \"What did she die of?\" A really unnecessary and insensitive question. When I said, \"How is that relevant?\" she merely shrugged and said I had to tell her. Back to British Airways for me!Hi  Accoring to the web site Does anybody have any experience of this, as we are nervous about people moving our carThe bottom line on Delta Coach:Delta\\'s other planes are configured with so little seat room, leg room, etc. (i.e., pitch) that they are like CROWDED CATTLE CARS. The airline should be ashamed to even put people on those planes, but clearly Delta does not care one iota about its passengers\\' comfort, even for long flights. I made the mistake on a recent HNL to LAX flight of flying Delta coach on a 757; never again! So check before you book, and if it\\'s a newer 767, the plane should be ok (better pitch, personal entertainment unit, etc.) You can ckeck pitch and seat specs at seatguru.com.(Toronto to Las Vegas return). From the counter staff at the airports, to the crew on the plane, everyone was very pleasant and professional. We will travel Westjet whenever we can in the future - they have definitely earned my business. ktownwhich will take me to Melbourne.My MH & EK flights are on the same ticket while my NZ flight is on a separate flight.

I\\'m absolutely panicking!please?Hi We are trying to get a good deal so we have more money to play with for hotels any advice would be much appriciated franOne Travel.com now charges $12 to assign a seat--any seat. When I called, they said that business is changing--a polite way to say \"Too bad for you.\" Is this becoming the norm? I usually fly Alaska and have no such problems, but booking this trip to Europe through OneTravel has been one irritation after another. I strongly suggest avoiding OneTravel.travel-rants.com/2008/… Let\\' me know what you think Darren :)Hi all! This will be the first time I am traveling out of the country.Thanks!The flight from Paris CDG arrives at SLC at 1:30pm and departs at 2:55pm. I know this is tight, but is it feasible?We have been stranded in O\\'Hare for over three hours waiting for a connecting flight, and customer service has been completely in informative about when a plane will be available. We decided to switch to a flight that appears to be on the ground and will depart in an hour...over 4 hours after our original flight, causing us to miss a $200 event this evening. In addition, United Airlines staff can\\'t tell us where our bags are or if they will make it to our final destination Flights out were fine but in width we could only just sit in them and When i mentioned this to the airhostess she just told me to sit up! Is this right?Should we not have been advised of the change of plane and also given either better seats (if there were any) or a refund on our flight?I didn\\'t know this forum really existed, so I believe I might get a better answer here perhaps.

Some loose tea boxes opened, though package within undamaged.i\\'ve got such a mixed message from online. Half saying I don\\'t need a prescription and the other saying i do. They\\'re still in the boxes as they\\'re unopened which has my name, date of issue and the doctors surgery, address etc. When I\\'ve traveled to Europe I\\'ve never needed one and I\\'ve never even had them in the boxes. But I\\'ve never done long haul or that strict of security. Thanks.I just booked a flight on American Airlines to Tokyo and when I saw the break down of my fare,From the research I\\'ve done online, these fees have typically applied only through British Airways and Iberia. Why am I being charged this on an AA flight?We booked our leg from MSP to which gets in at 6:30 am, but we are trying to decide which flight to bookWe want to allow for enough time to go through passport check and go back through security. There is a 10:15am flight to London, an 11am flight, and a 4:10.The flight itinerary is Seattle-Chicago-Zurich with the Seattle-Chicago leg on United and Chicago-Zurich leg on Swiss. The return is the reverse with Zurich-Chicago on Swiss and Chicago-Seattle on United. I selected this routing because I wanted to purchase from United but fly Swiss for the transatlantic. I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated. I\\'ve flown commercially frequently, but am still a bit inexperienced with codeshares. With United-Air Canada booked through United, I could use the AC locater provided by United on the AC web site to get to my reservation. Seems a bit different this time.

Just wondering what they are for selecting seatsTasteless food, narrow seats, suitable for size 0 person, you can\\'t move in your seats without banging your elbow with the passenger next to you, very little leg space, on top of that rude behaviour by the cabin crew, that was my recent experience.

Sofitel looks more run down for a top brand. Thanks alland if so whichor will we be regretting our decision?I travelled to Australia using STA travel . Never again. I was taken ill and admitted to hospital and had to change my flights. STA travel informed my husband and I that we had to re-book our tickets immediately, that they would be held for 10 days, each ticket at a cost of £150 each; that after the 10 days if they had not been used then we would have to re-book for another 10 days at another £150 each and so on. Clearly I had no idea when I could travel back to the UK. Clearly this advice was absolute rubbish. The Airline and our travel insurance sorted it all out, no problem. The 10 day rule by STA and the £150 each ticket is clearly a money making exercise. I have been offered a paltry compensation, which I have not accepted. Customer services does not appear to be contactable by phone; they do not reply to letters. Now what do I do?Looked on their website and they only mention excess baggage which is what I\\'m trying to avoid.until after the date we are due to travel, a week todaythe passport office are being very inflexible and it looks like we are not going on holiday now.The Dublin-Boston and return Bosston-Dublin segments are both available and bookable right now, as is the Cardiff-Dublin on the 29th March.

Thanks!Hi,We booked online and chose our seats specifically because i have had two operations on my knees and need to have a seat where i can get out of the seat easily and excercise my legs, so we have booked a b and c seat the c seat on the aisle.

Also Virgin do not have a web check-in on international flights only domestic. Has anyone had this problem as i am now a bit worried.We\\'ve got plenty of time to do so, just it would be a bit of a rigmarole. Thanks Edited That of course should read -check our bags - but I can\\'t edit the title. Edited: 11:36 am, February 02, 2012I have read the website and I want some clarification if anyone can help please I am probably being slow on the uptake but did not think it was clear on website??Hi, I just used my miles to book a car from National Car Rental for 7 days, and they give me some sort of confirmation number. But when I try to look it up on National web site, that number does not work. When I called Delta Skymiles, of course they are no help and just tell me to call the car rental company. I am going to try to call National and see what is going on in case the reservation never goes through. But just want to check with the group and see if anyone has any experience with it. Thanks.hi,in october 2010 plus which is a big leap ...........so was last year a really good deal orhere is my wholeWhen I arrived at Rome to check in and check my bag the lady gave me 3 boarding passes for all my flights and one luggage receipt with each connection listed on it including my final destination.although the property was nice, We signed up for trip alerts and didn\\'t receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn\\'t buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn\\'t even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded. First and last time flying with Sunwing. You couldn\\'t pay me to fly with them ever again.Hi there, There is $400 difference between Emirates and Turkish, Emirates being the more expensive. Pros of Emirates: Chauffeur driven Massive airport Cons: More expensive 777-300ER which means 2-3-2 seatings, angled bed and no bar Let me know what you think. ThanksHello guys,thanks a lot!TIAMy wife and I flew Delta from JFK to Rome, Italy early June 2010. It was a nightmare. The plane had mechanical problems forcing us to divert to Halifax, Nova Scotia for nearly 10 hours!  The flight crew was impolite and unhelpful, not to mention misleading in keeping passengers up to date on when we\\'d be back on schedule to our destination. Since we came home and shared this experience with friends and family we\\'ve heard that our story is nothing new. Delta has a well established reputation for messing up travel plans of passengers. So my advice to you is avoid Delta Air Lines. - ReubenCan any one advise about Is there a frequent shuttle?but I just noticed that multi-city trips where you don\\'t return to your original departure city are also cheaper than singles. I was looking at travelling Munich-Vienna-Paris. My first plan was take the train for Munich-Vienna then fly Vienna-Paris. Except that if I buy flight tickets for MUC-VIE-CDG on a single itinerary, it\\'s cheaper than if I buy single VIE-CDG ticket (by more than half). I\\'m a KrisFlyer member so I was looking at LH/OS flights.After 40 minutes googling and browsing the BA website (even trying to actually buy the tickets), I haven\\'t yet understood how much will I pay to change the date of my return. The only helping thing I\\'ve found is this paragraph, but following their logic I should buy the ticket first to see what type is it. What type of ticket do you have? If you\\'re unsure of the type of ticket you have, you can log into Manage My Booking to find out. By selecting your flight and then clicking on the Change / Cancel booking option you can see whether or not changes can be made free of charge, with a charge, or not at all. Could you help me? Edited: 12:35 pm, April 08, 2015I haven\\'t yet booked this flight as I know all the issues about flight not departing on time etc. The flight is from SFO-DEL in November with Cathay Pacific....in my online searches it appears a number of flights through HKG have only a minimal ( i.e. 1 hour layover) which leads me to wonder if they have a stellar transfer time there.http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0119/air.html ryanair.com/en/…100119-IAA_STRIKE_20_JAN-GB http://www.aerlingus.com/cgi-bin/obel01im1/Services/disruption_2001.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1390689674.1263931610@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccceadejgmgdgklcefecfigdffgdfkg.0&P_OID=0&Category=3 Edited: 3:07 pm, January 19, 2010Hi (front are not available)I don\\'t want to get Obstruction from the wings of aircraft Thank youHey all,later in the year. I\\'ve managed to score economy seat 36K, but I\\'ve read a couple of other places that the staircase leading down to the snack-bar is \\'roped\\' off - just want to know if I\\'ll need to plan ahead to bring my own snacks on-board or if I should try for a seat change if I\\'m going to have issues. Thanks!!Hi all will be flying from Manchester on the 21st juneI finally decided to bit the bullet and buy my airline tickets for my November trip to Italy. It never failsI need to stop looking and torturing myself. lol. I hate the airline ticket gamble. lolThe price was excellent, my husband and I flew from Birmingham to Dublin return at a total cost of £40. We followed their terms and conditions re luggage size etc and online check-in without any problems. They emailed us reminders of both online check in and luggage sizes more than once prior to our departure flight. The flights were on time and we were very pleased with how everything had gone. We will most certainly use them again as we were very impressed. Huge thanks to them for ensuring our 30th wedding anniversary trip went well flights wise. I appreciate that other travellers sometimes have had genuine issues, I just felt it would be good and fair to say when something goes well.Hello! Long story short,mine being 10inches instead of 9inches but total detentions height+ width + depth is 47inches Lufthansa is 62 inches total sizeand absolutely hate plane food (always have horrible stomach pains after eating it) etc with what I can bring instead of paying large amounts of money for food beyond customs which is equally horrible. Is only snack food ok or can I bring like peanut butter sandwiches as well? Someone please let me know what they have done before and if they have had things thrown out on them.Can anyone help please,  thanksHiI want to check in on line to get a good seat. But I was thinking as my flight stops in Hong Kong and I get off and get on another planethe last thing I want is to have no clothes on my holiday :-(( ?not basinetts)there\\'s been some staffing issues with Immigration officers (or lack thereof).  before you\\'re processed and able to claim your bag..Does anyone know the truth of this? ThanksI always use Kayak, etc, to search for flights, then buy direct from the airline. This time, it\\'s not working out that way... I\\'m trying to get from upstate NY (Ithaca, Syracuse) to Managua, Nicagragua. I\\'m getting a great deal ($250 less than airlines) through Orbitz and Priceline. The deal is with Copa Airlines.Although the US flights are code-share with United, Copa won\\'t even let me choose an upstate NY airport, so no luck booking direct from them. United.com, for the same flights, is much more expensive. Although I can get flights on American, it\\'s the cost that\\'s luring me to the Orbitz price. As long as I don\\'t have to make any changes to my itinerary once it\\'s booked, I can\\'t see why I shouldn\\'t go for it...but going 3rd party always make me a tad nervous.Thoughts/advice?Hi everyone,(destination city does not matter). Coming home from Buffalo, I can do BUF-PHL-Harrisburg for very cheap and hop off in PHL. But getting to Buffalo, especially nonstop, is expensive. SoI\\'ve done some research but no luck yet, so any help would be greatly appreciated :)Recently we flew to the Maldives with Etihad.by which I think they meant that economy was overbooked. The check-in staff had overridden our pre-booked seats and gave us different seats. Their reason was the overbooking, but I couldn\\'t understand what that had to do with it. So basically it\\'s done like I\\'ve booked flights for two people with the exact same name(mine). Thanks.I noted with interest the discussion a few days ago about not sitting unmins next to males. The older child,16 refused to fly and stayed with the 13 year old,they were then given some vouchers,about $500 dollars for 2,and told to take the shuttle to the hilton. It took the pair a few minutes to find the shuttle,then on arrival the hilton refused to accomodate them,because they were both under 18. Fortunately,Hilton called USAIR and demanded they send a rep/chaparone to collect the children,and took care of the pair. USAIR finally booked them into the airport Marriott,with the chaparone in the next room. The children travelled the next day,unharmed,so all\\'s well that ends well.Not sure if they sat next to a single male or not.The DOT complaint should make interesting reading.I can\\'t find anyone who will allow me to book more than 9 tickets online. Please help me! Thank you!Just to let you know I live near Heathrow and Gatwick. (which is fine we are going to have a nice night in Dublin before we fly), I have to collect all my baggage before I leave airport. I dont collect air points, I dont fly a lot so am not worried about any air miles or anything, I am booking it online. I just want to make sure there is not a fine. Will they even bother to ask me?

Hi I haven\\'t flown into our out of LAX for over 15 years. (assuming the Singapore Airlines flight from Tokyo arrives on time at 1:00). Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.airport,it consists of escorted by staff off plane through passport control,immigration and case retrieval. And on. return executive lounge and same as above for £100 for two people,after last years waiting for 2 hours in the heat it sounds a good service,any comments pleasefor Manila to Hong Kong, and later that day had a connecting with British Airways to London. I received a conformation email, bill invoice and checked my bank statement to see that the money had been taken out. Upon arrival for my flight, i was told that i didn\\'t have a reservation due to a card being declined. I was rushing around Manila airport to try and solve this, ended up getting an hour bus in Manila traffic to another terminal to speak to customer service and they couldnt help me. I had a connecting flight later so i had to fly that day. I was forced to book another flight which left in two hours and cost alot more than the original. thank god they had another flight with space on it otherwise i would have missed my connecting flight too. I arrived back on the 11th and have since been trying to contact them. on their website they have a UK number which apparently is open 24 hrs. The number is not recognised, i called the Bravo Fly car service to try and get transferred. I spoke to a very grumpy man telling me its a completely different company and he is getting ridiculous amounts of calls everyday regarding the same thing! I have been basically been robbed and this could have turned out alot worse than it did had i missed my connecting flight. Please please let me Hi everyone,  so it a lot of money. Any comments will be greatly received.I have upcoming flights with UA which includes a layover in IAD and have access to the UA Club Lounges (at Gates C7, C17 or D8).  or should I just use the one closest to my departure gate. Thanks in advance for any information.We are arriving from our holidays back at T5 LHR with a few extra check in bags. We have parked the car at the long stay park. As we have one too many bags to fit in our car, we are thinking may be one of us should take the National express bus from the airport to home. But I remember reading in this forum that there are Hello,and we are travelling on the a380. of the upstairs behind business class. Carol.I am a bit confused, This is stated in the rules, but not made clear during purchase. They state that an Economy Plus purchase is not refundable, but do not make clear that you may not change the itinerary without losing your economy plus seat.On way back we fly with BA on world traveller flight on a 777 I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said \"the system\" wouldn\\'t let them check her in because she\\'s two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn\\'t get \"el sistema\" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don\\'t fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult \"el sistema\" wouldn\\'t let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they\\'ll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They\\'ll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they\\'ll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they\\'ll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you\\'re lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he\\'ll tell his reps to tell you \"he\\'ll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund.

Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It\\'s also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer OfficerThese closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you\\'d be advised to contact your airline. If you\\'re planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.Hi, I\\'m wondering if it is possible to change the \\'return\\' round trip flights to another departure location?... I originally bought the round trip tickets: \"Toronto->China\" and \"China->Toronto\". In between I\\'m also planning on going to other nearby countries(Hongkong, Taiwan, Japan). I haven\\'t bought other tickets yet, including the last flight from \"Japan->China\" (the one I\\'m trying to avoid buying right now) The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto. But right now something came up and I will have to return early... Basically, I\\'m asking if there\\'s a way to change my return roundtrip flight from \"china->toronto\" to \"japan->toronto\"? so I won\\'t have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight. :( Please let me know what would be the best option for me. Thankss :)Mtrip to africa had a great time but ran into some difficulties south african airways maind office told me i had to buy all new to i was on phone for many hours my phlights were already sold out so i ended up buying all new tickets. i was metting my sister in johanesberg aweek after i left jfk and she was going to bring my tickets that my wife sent from hawaii fed X TO L. A.so ionly needed e ticket for first week of trip. When i got to jfk the manager for south african airlines was great gave me e tickets why couldent main office do that.Cheap tickets told me they dont give out hard copies but that is what they sent me . when i got home i tried to get refund. Cheap tickets should have refunded me when i called them back they gave me the attitude like it is not our broblem then i went with credit card they said no problems then i week later said i had to deal with south african aifways i dealt with them for 3 months never geting a call back, manager never in office left numuerous msgs. finally i only got half of my money back i stll lost out on $2,300,00. I work for a major hotel been in the bussiness for 30 years would never treat guest like that my sister who used cheap tickets too and me will never use them again and south african airways needs to change there polices.everybody at south african except for main office were great.This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.Just thought I would let you travelers know about it. Very disappointed.. Followed their instructions to the letter and had 2 failed calls before getting hold of someone who said they would call us when he knew when he would be there. Booked them for 04:30 and they had not turned up or answered their phone by 04:50 and check in was closing at 05:10. Gatwick Valet parking came to the rescue and got the car parked and to check in with 4 minutes to spare. Sticking to Gatwick Valet parking from now on. At least the car was kept under cover and on site.Excuse the naivete of this question. long--as in so I have the entire day in ZurichPlan to take the train to city centre, do some touring etc.Don\\'t know why it bothering me to check it through to final destination, just never have actually let my luggage sit that long in transit. (I suppose I could check it to Zurich, claim it and check in again at night...am not flying economy so checking in again would not take too long and Zurich has a left luggage office so I can store it and my carry on bag there)I just received from them. I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank\\'s confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they\\'d give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn\\'t take that out and call it good.I am Vietnamese. On 25 July 2016, my application visa was denied by the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City, and one denial stamp was put on the last page of my passport. The reason why I applied for the visa because I planned to visit Jeju Island in 2 days and then to spend 6 next days in Seoul. However, because my application was denied, I intend to change my plan that I will visit Jeju Island only without going to Korea mainland. I will have a direct flight from Shanghai to Jeju Island without transiting at any airport on the Korea mainland.With the denial stamp on the passport, am I still allowed to enter Jeju? As I know, Jeju Island has the free entry visa policy. However, I am concerning that due to the denial stamp, I am not entitled to enjoy such policy. Since my trip will start on 10 September 2016, your quick response would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. P/S: Is there anyone having experience on this one before?Question----a few months ago. A couple of days ago,It is hardly the end of the world, and can manage with the change, but I feel like I am getting less than I paid for, as Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...--- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we\\'d be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.For those of you who are not familiar with Westjet, it is a Canadian discount carrier that we have flown for years. It has been very solid and reliable for us and is our domestic airline of choice. However, Westjet seems to be encountering some problems, seemingly from its conversion to a new reservation system. (I have been trying for 24 hours.) The wait to speak to a customer service rep is currently 45 - 60 minutes and they warn you that they can only accept credit card payment at this time. I have looked online, but it is the same situation. In the meantime, the current seat sale deadline is fast approaching. Are there any Westjetters (or anyone else) out there who can provide some clarification as to what is going on and how long before it is sorted out (i.e., I can use my travel credits)? Thanks so much.So... I booked a flight with Aeromexico from London to Mexico City yesterday evening, at a pretty awesome price (compared to BA/Air France/KLM). HOWEVER, since I made the booking I have already had 3 pretty stressful phonecalls with a travel agency called \"Bravo Travel\" who seem to be processing the booking. The English Aeromexico website doesn\\'t seem completely finished yet and didn\\'t ask for any of my personal details, such as date of birth, nationality, passport etc., so these have to be given over the phone. This is where the problems started, as the person from \\'Bravo Travel\\' doesn\\'t speak English and cannot understand me. And I, on the other hand, am extremely confused and frustrated that I can\\'t speak to Aeromexico directly (or email them, for that matter).  or has someone else on here already tried them and can help me?? I can\\'t seem to talk to anyone who can write down my passport details correctly! I am already stressed out because now I think there\\'ll be something wrong with the ticket... :( Any input would be much appreciated!I like to fill out the application for travel insurance correctly so that if I should need it in case of emergency, the insurance company can\\'t claim that my application was invalid because I did it wrong. The problem is that I\\'ve asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I\\'ve gotten 3 different answers. I don\\'t think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn\\'t correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA. YIKES....I don\\'t know what to do now?  How do I avoid future trouble about this??? Thanks.or does Silk work as an independent \\'budget\\' point-to-point airline? I am looking at a flight schedule that has 2 hours between arriving into Singapore (Changi SIN) at 05:55 (T3) on a Singapore Airlines flight, departing on a Silk Air flight at 07:55 (T2). If I can check baggage right through at the start of my journey and simply transit airside from T3 to T2, I think this will work. If I have to get my baggage, pass immigration, re-check in and pass back thro\\' immigration it won\\'t! Grateful for any advice. Cheers, MarkOkay, so these airline tickets were bought for us by our daughter who booked it all, she is now abroad to hard to contact right now, we travel to NY on Thurs., but our tickets with Norwegian Airlines which our daughter emailed to us show nothing regarding which airport we fly into - pretty important because a relative is picking us up. There are no airport codes that I can see. Have copied and pasted those details and as you can see it just says New York not JFK or Newark or the codes for said airport., have a phone number to ring and will ring that if nobody on here knows. Thanks. xThis is a terrible, fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We\\'ve been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They\\'ve had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn\\'t get any worse than that. Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company? Goes to show that if you\\'ve never heard of the company and want to purchase online, look them up on the Better Business Bureau first. That was our biggest mistake!Both if them are relatively fussy eaters and would prefer a child\\'s meal on the plane.  Child\\'s meal is showing in the confirmation for my 12yo, but this was confirmed by that travel agent who made the booking for us 10 months ago. Now So, my question is -  I tried ringing them last night but after being in the queue for 30+ minutes I abandoned the mission.I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask. Thomson Flight Booking: Easily done online with no problems. We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn\\'t let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy.

It was then that the reservations clerk said - Oh this is a non-stop flight so it will be $280 to re-book. AS we had just come through a very trying experience I was in no position to change planes in Kingston. I wrote to Air Jamaica and they have never written back. Further there is no way to get in touch with a human reservations clerk in the US. Not a very good situation.

Regards DaveHi All Ive been reading many topics about Philadelphia airport as its our first time flying to america (new york). Ive been checking about time between connecting flights and how far Term A is from Term F etc.... Reading some of the replies, though.... Ive picked up that some people have said that we need to go through customs/security and then collect our luggage BUT  Or will we have to collect our luggage when we land at PHL and then check it in again on our connecting flight to LGA? Thanks :)hi allbecause i dont want to pay 170.00 to change itCruising the dream Dec 4th 2015?Hi allComments would be welcome pleaseI was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don\\'t fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I\\'m new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I\\'ve read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I\\'ll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it\\'s not too bad (plus it\\'s a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here\\'s my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta.Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it\\'s the same physical airplane for both legs. I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That\\'s really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG, on any routes. I have tried calling the airline and emailing them, but received no reply.Thanking you.(I am planning on taking thngs to my daughter who is a missionary in Kiev)  I emailed NW and they just basically emailed me back copied info from their website that didn\\'t answer my question.I usually fly Zoom these days but have priced fares for April and (I refuse to use Air Canada).I have never been to that airport so not sure if we have a far distance to walk to connect or if all Jetblue flights leave.from the same terminal.

Thanks for any helpHi everybody, I\\'m really worried becauseJust for a surname! The rest is correct. Does anyone know a solution? Have you been in the same situation any of you. Thanks a lot!!!!!!!There are two sections on this plane outfitted with these seats in rows 2-5 and 10 and 11, the latter two rows being exit rows. Only those in row 11 are rated good seats in SeatGuru, i.e., green. Those in rows 2-5 are rated standard, white; and row 10 has drawbacks, yellow.  I went ahead and selected a seat a window green seat in row 11, but was interested in others\\' experience with extra legroom seats on this plane. I can still change since other seats are still available. Responses much appreciated.

I can\\'t see how to do this online, so I\\'m not sure if its possible...forgive me if its a stupid question, I\\'m just a rookie :)i hear it can take some time at customs. when i look at the flights a lot of them only have like an hour and ten minutes or an hour ans 30 minutes. but that seems w way to short ( dont know why they sell flight with so little time between flights ). Hi all, My passport is going to expire in a couple of months andI just need to renew my passport so I’m assuming it’s just the expiry date that I need to update once I’ve got my new passport.

ThanksAloha from Kaua\\'i!(well, almost flat)I have checked the \"Suite Dreams\" site and it shows 33% of the planes have been changed - has anyone flown this class recently and had the \"new\" configuration? We were lucky enough last year on one portion of our trip to Paris to have the \"newly configured\" seating and it was so nice! I\\'m hoping for a miracle that this year we might luck out again! Just wondering how likely this is in your opinion. Malama Pono, JanetHere is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.Thinking about flying with them for the first time andThanksYour advice would be really appreciated.My instinct is telling me its possible & there is enough time,but i am just looking for reassurance.We are also saving 350euro which is almost the cost of our hotel for the week by doing it the long way round.

My spare pram ( Silvercross Surf ) folds up in 2 parts ( the seat unit and then the chassis part ) so my question is: is this allowed to bring to the gate? I have tried reading through the fqa\\'s on the ryanair website but this is not clear at all...it basically just says one pushchair is allowed per child..They always asks me though when travelling by the check in if i want to bring the pram to the gate and does it collapse...Really don\\'t want to end up paying 30 pounds per way if having to check it in, which is the cost at the airport for checked in baby equipment and then having to carry my 7 month old baby around for the next 2 hours lol ( in that case i rather buy a cheap 2nd hand buggy on a facebook selling group to bring with me as 60 quid return is more than the pram cost me lol ) Any help will be much appreciated =)Then onwards to Heathrow. who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry.After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. his was not the end of our troubles. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. The questions is. My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend\\'s case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend\\'s mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I\\'m waiting for the reply email which I don\\'t know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!Hi, I am flying in November from Orlando to Las Vegas with American Airlines. Looking over my flights, I\\'m not really feeling confident and just wanted to check if I should go ahead with this flight, or if I should be contacting American to see about a change? That first connection time is very short. I am just a bit concerned that myself or my luggage might not make it.Just was after an opinion of what people think I should do, or if it would be fine? :) (also all the flights are on the same ticket, purchased at the same time) Thanks Edited: 3:51 am, August 04, 2016We just signed up for a United Credit Card so that we can build up miles for a trip we are planning. All miles on the card will go to my husbands account. We both have about 12K miles on our United miles accounts. I wanted to transfer mine to his until I learned it would cost me $180.00 to do so. I was used to Hawaiian Airlines mileage account and this was a free transaction. Also, by obtaining the United Mileage Explorer credit card, the primary person gets priority boarding and 2 checked bags free. Their traveling companion will get the same as long as their are on the same reservation. So I can\\'t use my miles to get a ticket seperatelly. On Hawaiian, you don\\'t have to be on the same reservation but just traveling together. Some of this doesnt\\' make sense to me so I want to be sure I am understanding this correctly. Can anyone point me to a board so I can ask questions by those that may be more knowledgeable. Thank youespecially if you connect through Philly.  I\\'ll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase. Lesson learned...pack some clothes and necessties in carryon in case you get stuck, and fly non stop if available. this was posted weeks ago and is still on there. They have now added another entry saying that GB customers will get 1 case up to 20 kilos and both of these conflicting items are still on their website. I phoned last Friday and they confirmed the 23 kilos was right, I phoned yesterday and they said it was 20 kilos and the lady had to look on line to find out what I ment, then she came back to me and said that the 23kilos was a mistake and they would only allow up to 20 kilos. When the sale went through and the e mail was sent out they say one thing and as soon as you confirm they move the goal post. I told them that it obviously not a mistake but a deliberate change of their mind. As our flight going out is still with GB and now coming back with Easyjet with 2 different allowances which is really annoying, as they also informed me that one case cannot be 22 kilos and another 18 which is even more annoying. I have printed off the website answer to the question which says that GB passengers will not have their baggage allowance changed, do you think I have a leg to stand on if I take this to the airport. Sorry to go on. I have to wonder exactly who ticked the market research box \"Yes, please stop helping me pass the time with films and other entertainment and try to squeeze another £7.50 out of me instead\". GeoffI made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. willy nilly (although you can bet it\\'s the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn\\'t get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn\\'t going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it\\'s a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I\\'m afraid that I\\'ll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can\\'t think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.Hiwith no problems Many ThanksI read a lot of bad things for govolo. Please does anyone know, during the time when confirmation is pending, and I have not yet received confirmation, and I have not yet paid, Thanks a lot.I have searched on net and found out some trip advisor forum question as well regarding the same issue, but those were for some other carrier and not Indigo. So wanted to be sure about Indigo, if anyone have first hand experience. Name change on ticket is not allowed and cancellation and re booking will cost me at least 5000 INR :(. Please help.I flew recently with Qatar Airways between Melbourne and Nairobi. When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket. Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours. Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me. All in all my flight from the moment of check in to when I landed was an absolute nightmare. Hello! long time lurker, looking for some advice.eks in August, on Air India, back in August.Basically, the family member we were planning to visit has now passed away, so we are not really able to travel any more at this particular timebut have scoured the bravely website to no avail. I can\\'t find a breakdown of the cost of my booking or how much of it is taxes, etc. I know I can ring them and ask them but I\\'d like to have all the facts to hand before I do so! I can see also that a voucher can be offered, but even that\\'s not clear as to how it is calculated. Not sure how to proceed,I can see on here that they seem to have a bad rep! thanks in advance valmiki was devastated, some so rare items, I dare not think about it. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem.Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don\\'t know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!Hi Having never booked a flight myself before I didn\\'t know that this was actually a very short time in terms of changing flights. The two flights are with different airlines (Air Berlin and BA) but I booked them with triptsa not realising it was a fairly bad site.. The planes are in different terminals but I\\'m not sure how big the airport is and if this would be possible. Any help is really appreciated!! ThanksI\\'m having a real problem withregarding a pre-booked return flight for four people. The flights are part of an Easter holiday for the family. The email they sent us is from a blind address - you can\\'t reply to it. There\\'s no email address given on their website for problems or complaints. Their telephone number does not respond (it\\'s a recording that that goes through several menus and then ends in a dead line) and their fax number comes up on my machine saying \\'cannot transmit to this number\\'. Anyone in Australia had this experience, found anotherNot only are the flights rarely ontime, and you can count on missing your connections, BUT they also refuse to provide the passengers with any information whatsoever about what the amount of time the delay will be, nor the reasons for the delays. They did not provide a meal even when the delay was for three hours and the passengers were kept aboard a plane without water or food. Little children were crying, saying \"mommy I am hungry\". I will never fly on LIAT again. and if that means I do not go to St. Vincent, well, I guess I won\\'t be going there.Hi, i wonder if its normal. Its not in my spam. Just didn\\'t get one. I already paid via paypal. Ive contacted the support but didn\\'t get a reply since 2 days. Anyone could help me out? Is that normal?Our flight (Myself and my girlfriend), number AR7575 from Mendoza to Cordoba at 19:25 was cancelled and nobody advises us anticipatively. Due to the cancelation, we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas (from Cordoba to Sao Paulo). After 3 hours waiting, the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 23/06 at 06:00. So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending.Never more we would choose this wretched airline.I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me. Moreover, if I wasn’t a special member from TAM I would not arrived in Sao Paulo because there wasn’t available flight for us and Aerolineas did anything.We flew on Southwest last week. Before we left for the airport, we checked the flight status, and saw that our flight was delayed. It showed a new departure time one half hour later than the scheduled time, and also showed \"NTP.\" We took our time getting to the airport. When we got to the gate, the board showed our flight as \"delayed\" with no scheduled time. Fifteen minutes before the original departure time, they began boarding, and the plane left at the scheduled time. We were glad that we hadn\\'t dawdled too much!I would like to be able to charge my cell phone & laptop. Thank you!(which has had an engaged tone continuously since yesterday afternoon!)Good grief this is harder than I thought! Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn\\'t be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent!even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise.I really don\\'t want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I\\'ve found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn\\'t working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and Hello I paid for a return transfer and didn\\'t want to spend time finding an Internet cafe or somewhere with wifi to sort something out that I thought I\\'d be prebooked as I only have a short weekend trip away...please help!As soon as the tickets become available,According to my research thus far,- row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency.- it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse. - there is no reason to charge extra to get LESS legroom! RobinWe\\'ve been European travelers for more years than I can remember - at least one trip per year or more. We\\'ve never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we\\'ve always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I\\'ve noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who\\'ve encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies. This has gotten me thinking that maybe we\\'ve just been lucky all these years. Last year, we were in the Benelux countries during the volcano eruption. Our luck held, as the no-fly ban was lifted on the day we left (in fact, our booked tix were on the first UAL flight allowed out of Brussels). So...we\\'re heading to the UK in May and we are taking a Rick Steves tour of Rome in October before heading on to other Italian cities. Now - Has anyone any recommendations? On Rick Steve\\'s website, he\\'s mentioned about four companies - but is very careful not to recommend a particular one. I\\'ve investigated one just to see what the rates are (Access America), but am wondering if any of you experienced people have any recommendations or cautions to share. Thanks for any help.I used them because I currently live in Khartoum and there are not many websites that will service that airport. I thought that I had found a really good deal but then when I arrived at the airport at 2:00 am it was to find that the confirmation that I received was not valid and I was not booked onto any flights. When calling them from the airport the curt customer service rep said that there was nothing that they could do and that I had to buy my ticket at the counter. After this and many, many emails, phone calls and credit card forms having to be filled out and faxed in I received an itinerary that was $600 more then originally quoted, a flight that was highly inconvenient that added 15 hours onto my trip and basically cut out 2 days of my vacation. Stay far away from this company.I wanted to pass on my experience to travelers trying to get a passport in under 3 weeks from travel date. I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don\\'t get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don\\'t be scared.  Suggestions don\\'t forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016We recently flew Delta LHR-ATL in economy and when I checked in it said we could check 2 bags for free (each). When I look it up on Delta\\'s website, it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag. delta.com/content/… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged. The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn\\'t seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart. Obviously I\\'m not complaining, but I\\'d like to understand so I know in the future if we are entitled to 2 bags. Thanks.Here is the link to the news article: time.com/time/… They can stuff it. If the rich dudes and money heavy (government) organizations that are proposing this think developing countries need more money, then donate more themselves. Or ensure that what money gets donated already goes directly to the essential materials and staff for the programs needed, and not to corrupt country middlemen or into the pockets of some despot who is more than willing to let aid into their country, but only if his pockets gets lined with a percentage.Hiya, as my other half is very fussy with food. Thanks :)Got to say though the most frustrating part of all this is not knowing what was happening. From being given a reference number at Barcelona to it being delivered I\\'ve been unable to track it as my number wasn\\'t recognised. I\\'ve emailed them with no response at all. Have tried ringing and just got an answer machine telling me all lines are busy & to try again later and the most frustrating has been after 5 days trying to complete an online form which then generates a text message directing you to complete the same form. Still think Vuelling have major problems but for anyone who is still waiting for delayed baggage, hope you get the same outcome as meHi, NathGiven that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back homeand asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises.  I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Thank you all, AndreasFeb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don\\'t know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don\\'t care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting.They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.I flew recently with Qatar Airways between Melbourne and Nairobi.

CosmopolHi, I\\'m flying Gold Coast, AUS to Narita airport, Japan at the end of the month. It\\'s a direct flight (no stop-overs), leaving at 10:50 and arriving in Japan at 18:55pm. Sleeping isn\\'t really an option, I suck at sleeping through the day and there is only a 1 hour time difference between Aus and Japan. I\\'m bringing my iPod touch, and other interesting activities. Also, Thanks in advance.Hi,Strange question I know but we wanted to wrap our pushchair up to protect it as when we travelled to Turkey last year they ruined our pushchair and this is a new one. Many thanks :).I think he had Cerebral Palsy. We were in the row behind and asked whether this was okay to the chief stewardess.Her reply was that there were 2 able bodied passengers capable of opening the door so it was okay.If there was an emergency waiting for him or trying to get around him would be difficult as would communication . We have heard the exit row spiel many times and they always say you must report to the crew if you are not able to fulfill duties and so does the written onboard . (Air Asia flight 1 hr duration)Hello, Thanks for all help!!!next year and Are the seats separated, which seems a bit strange. Obviously traveling long haul as a couple it\\'s far more convenient to be in a group of two instead of disturbing a third person when the need arises. And I am not sure which terminal I will be landing and leaving due to some complications, which are listed below. Flight details: YYC 19:15 -> LAX 21:23 United 8305 (operated by Air Canada 572) LAX 23:40 -> BWI 06:49 United 1650 From Terminal 2/6/7/8 to terminal 6/7/8 Thank you!Hello, I\\'ve had an e mail...(to which I\\'ve deleted! ) to tell me there are some differences in the luggage that I\\'m allowed to take....many thanks !Hi Going to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic tomorrow from Manchester, UK.No one item is over 23kg! Please get back to me asap I go tomorrow!I will be going to Bali in September and plan on taking a first aid kit containing Over the Counter meds in my carry-on bag. (Flying with carry-on ONLY.) I will be flying on Qatar Airways and transitting in Doha (Qatar). From what I understand, I will be leaving the secure zone when I land in Doha and will have to go through security to board the flight to Denpasar. My question is this:I assume most people will tell me that I can get these things in Bali but I would rather bring things from home. Thanks. ClaireHi If anyone has any useful tips on this that would be great. I\\'ve looked at doing some of the multi-city routes through some of the airlines but the closest I can bet is Royal Jordanian for £595 to Bangkok.Looking at flights cheapish  Any advice would be appreciated. ThanksHi We are flying to Bangkok with Air Asia from Trang next month, we have 6 hours to kill and we want to head into Trang Town, which is only 5km away, my question is, what facilities Trang airport has in the way of left luggage. I have searched the internet and there’s no information regarding facilities at this airport and I am hoping someone may have done the Koh Lipe – Trang airport route and advice me about left luggage facilities Thanksyes, it\\'s been a while since I\\'ve flown but I\\'m amazed that it will now cost me more to get to Chicago that it would to get to Aruba. I want to get to ORD this Sat. July 5.  (last minute travel) or is that just wishful thinking? I would go with Priceline, but I\\'m afraid I\\'ll end up on Spirit Air. All advice appreciated D. CrossMy husband and I have flights on hold for both Air France and Air Tahiti Nui in business class for travel October 6 or 7th from LAX to Paris. We have travelled 2 years ago on Air Tahiti in provera business class and it was great, but We are very particular travelers and want the best service and experience. This a trip for lesiure and a birthday! The Air France plane is a 777-200 an dthe air Tahiti is Airbus Please help.I fly this route annually/bi-annually to visit in-laws with my children and husband who were on this flight with me, they\\'re all fine (kids were 16 months and 3), I\\'m still a mess, can\\'t watch safety video and have to take valium. It\\'s getting a bit embarassing having to explain why I cry, especially when we don\\'t fly Qantas. Been told I\\'m not high priority enough to get treatment.My question is: The detailed explanation of restrictions on its Web site are unclear, as it states the $15 charge does not apply to passengers starting outside of the U.S. and continuing to international destinations. I am originating in Australia, and SFO is international relative to there, but not relative to LAX or American Airlines itself. Your help would be appreciated!I will be transiting Dubai soon en route to Oz. Never flown anywhere via Dubai before so am a bit wary about alcohol......not drinking it but having it in hand luggage. It is a special gift requested by a friend in Oz.....but don\\'t want to give myself any bother at airports...they are stressful enough places. Any advice? On there website it says you should check in 3 hours before your flight which is ridiculous. With club class you get priority check in ,so I don\\'t think its necessary to arrive 3 hours before. Edited: 1:51 pm, January 04, 2016Hi Leyland, Hopefully you can answer my question. I am sure Kind regards and thank youI have a 10hr layover so no issue with transit time, in fact i only ask as i intend to hire a day room at the travel lodge and would rather not cart my luggage around for the day. (2 adults and 3 kids) Thankyou kind peopleHey so to keep down holiday costs this year we have decided to use just hand luggage (should be doable)What I am wondering isie I know the max height according to there website is 21.5 inches. I have 2 bags to chose from here one is way over at 25inches and the other is 23inches. both are soft material just wondering what people would recommend. Thanks so muchWould value everyone\\'s opinion on  I prefer more direct, premium economy for any long legs. Ive thought melb - honolulu , rest then honalulu - orlando but cant seem to find any Melb - Hon direct fights .Looks like they closed your post by mistake when they removed the duplicate? I don\\'t see any other reason why the thread would be shut down: tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k5319628… Anyway, Buy a drink or something to eat and break down the note so she can get some coins and call you.That didn\\'t sound right to me bc I always had that fee included in my airline ticket. I have traveled to Cancun for 5 years straight. I asked the clerk to check again and he said it wasn\\'t included in my ticket. Something automatically wasn\\'t smelling right to me. He asked if I flew into Cancun on JetBlue. I responded that I used Continental (Newark to CUN). I didn\\'t have my Continental detailed receipt, so I paid the departure tax by credit card so I could dispute the charges later.Then get this, So was I really charged 3 times for the same thing? I called JetBlue and didn\\'t get a clear answer from a rep. I\\'ve learned now to carefully look at the taxes and fees and to print the receipts to take to the airport. Thanks for your help!flight I tried to change my earlier flight from Manchester but klm wouldn\\'t let me so need to know if it doable anybody Thankshello im wondering if anyone can help me please?f I canits not saying anything on my virgin log in page. thank you in advance trace xxanyway (by placing it along the diagonal & tilting it)? I\\'d really rather not have my laptop in the cabin bag should it be placed in the aircraft holder, seeing how carelessly they load them on. Edited: 12:02 pm, July 27, 2014Hello Everyone I will be flying to CPT on July 31st via DOH, and I need help with the transit process. These are my flights: QR764 (YUL-DOH) QR1369 (DOH-CPT) ----- BA6406 (operated by Comair Ltd) (CPT-JNB) QR1364 (JNB-DOH) QR763 (DOH-YUL) , or do I need to pick it up at JNB and check it in again, or do I do that at DOH? Thanks in advanceI see that a couple of the big middle eastern airlines do 1 stop services to Tehran with varying levels of (in)convenience with their connections. What I\\'d prefer to book though is one of the daily flights operated by Mahan Air (or depending on whether their winter schedule matches our dates, one of Iran Air\\'s flights on the 747SP!!!!). None of the usual booking engines or sites show the Mahan Air flights and the Mahan website doesn\\'t have a booking portal. Thanks!Hi,I got there yesterday but today when I went to see a res. I couldn\\'t get to the site at all!Hello Earlier this evening I am curious if anyone else has experienced this problem when using Safari? I searched previous forum posts but didn\\'t see anything mentioned. I will most likely attempt to retry the transaction tomorrow on my laptop as opposed to my iPad. Thank you Thank in advanceHello, we just booked our economy Seat Guru does not have the updated seat map for this plane. Would like these seats so nobody will be prodding the touchscreens all the way accross the pond but we be put off them if the seats wont recline. Many thanks PaulHello everyone, so here\\'s what happened. We have a trip scheduled to Madrid for November and we are flying with ryanair.The itinerary is thessaloniki-milan, milan-madrid and today I know we can get a refund for only one flight (the one that has been changed) but obviously this is not a solution since we have paid for four...I haven\\'t heard of this airline before.I heard the seats are truly quite hard and uncomfortable. This particular route usually flies an The TACA website shows the types of planes they have in their fleet, but no detailed seat maps. ...or have any advice on the seats, exit rows, etc.? Thanks! -HershelHi I hope an expert can help me here.I hope you can clarify. Thank youHas anyone else had this length of stop over? We arrive 7.30am and depart 11.25pm? I am travelling with an eleven year old and fourteen year old. Thanks I am due to fly to Sharm el sheikh from Dublin on Sunday but cannot get a definitive answer from the Panorama tour operators on whether a replacement aircraft has been made available. Would appreciate responses from anyone in a similar situation.A question for UK or non EU experts We have booked flights to Spain, out from UK with Vueling back with Iberia but did it through a third party site. ( presumably given by them to the site that booked for me) I cannot find a FAQ or email enquiry form to ask anyone directly.. has anyone any suggestions of what I should do next? Many thanks MilissaHi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats. As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, , so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a \\'no outside food policy\\' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)So seem to have pressed the mute button on the Michael O\\'Sleary remote control. Perhaps realising that pi55ing customers off is perhaps not the best business strategy in the world and that the same joke is just not funny year after year. Not all publicity is good publicity it appears. So they do seem on the face of it to have made some good improvements. They have a new marketing manager, team and it seems strategy. The website has been completely revamped and IMO looks and feels great. The stupid CAPTCHA thing has been removed. Credit & debit card charges have been reduced to a fair (or is that a fare) level. Reserved seating throughout the aircraft, allowing small handbags to be carried in addition to your carry on and an all round hug me I’m from Ryanair feeling. telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transpo… So anyone flown them recently and did you see improvements in attitude and service? Should I put them on my will fly list again?I have read several other posts on here about Allegiant Airlines and Disabled individuals expecting to receive more services than they are actually due because of their disabled status. I want to make sure you know I\\'m not one of those people.These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate.  I didn\\'t say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It\\'s going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I\\'m house bound because they just didn\\'t care to take care of something that is so important to me.Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we\\'ve taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we\\'ve made to switch our business to Delta.which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- While I\\'ve mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn\\'t exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it\\'s STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added.. USA Today: …usatoday.com/flights/…1 Travel Safe,Hi, as my son wears trainers or plimsolls or flip flops for holidays. Its really not suitable to wear his leather shoes just to enter the lounge and then be burdened with them all holiday. I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn\\'t the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C\\'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C\\'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O\\'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)Hi My daughter and I will have a 14 hour stopover from 20.20 on Sunday 7th August to 10.50 on Monday 8th August. Seems a very long time to be doing nothing. ThanksHi,I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank youBought tickets on Expedia for RT Albuquerque t o Cairo via Turksih Air for our family. Turkish Air flight was late leaving JFK. We would miss our connection to Cairo so they re-booked us on Egypt Air (much better airline than Turkish Air!!!!!) On our return flight, which we bought tickets for (and paid for and reserved seat assignments, frequent flyers miles numbers, special meals), we discovered Turkish Air re-sold our seats and I guess cancelled the reservation. The result was the absolute worst seats in the back of the plane, not sitting together as a family even though we were travelling with a child. Also, we apparently don\\'t get frequent flyer partner miles with this airline either, even though the Turkish Air agent on the phone and the ones in the airport assured us we would. Much better everything---customer service, flight attendants, food, AND they are on time or actually leave early if everyone is checked in! Never, ever fly Turkish Air. TerribleTheir website isn\\'t much help.I`ll always remember when we went to China back in 2008, the weather in August was too hot for me but the country was fascinating and the Eclipse was fantastic : aerialsandtv.com/…ChinaEclipse Unfortunately BOTH our suitcase failed on the same trip ! And, significantly, the zips went on both of them. So we needed new cases, we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones (having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain......) and, most importantly, no zips. And we found them ! American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range). The question is! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012I am flying from Johannesburg to Moscow with Swiss Air in September this year I have a stopover in Zurich on the way to Moscow Both Legs are on Swiss Air On the way there I have a 14.5hrs layover - I Land in Zurich at 6:10am & I leave Zurich for Moscow at 20:35 & On the way back I also have a 14.5hrs layover - I Land in Zurich at 8:20am & I leave from Zurich for JHB at 22:45 Last Year I flew Egypt Air from JHB to Cyprus & I had a Layover of 10hrs in Cairo and Egypt Air provided me with a hotel room for free including breakfast & lunch - So I thought that maybe Airlines were obliged to provide accomodation if the wait is over a certain number of hours Regards, ManiHi there later this week on a Schengen visa. The Lufthansa flight involves a 5 hour transit in Frankfurt. I\\'m a little unsure about customs and immigration rules. Grateful for any advice on this ThanksHi all,apologies if this question has been answered before,or the answer is staring me in the face on the BA home page. Any help gratefully acceptedWe traveled as a family of 12 (6 children and 6 adults) in Executive Class from JFK-DEL in December 2008 and returned from BLR-BOM-EWR Via Heathrow in January 2009 (also Executive). The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline\\'s grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years.... Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave. BOTTOM LINE IS: Fly Air India for Non-Stop flights only to India and expect virtually no ground service.(URGENT!)My name is ---------, and I need your help. I booked two ticket through BRAVOFLY in OCT. Recently, On my ticket my surname is “------” and my given name is “--”, but actually on my passport my first name is “--” and my given name is “------”. (I attached copy of my passport in my email) According to the Air Canada （i called them and confirmed the name situation）, if I don’t change the passenger name on my ticket though your company, I would not be able to get on board. so please help me. My plane is 3 days later and I have been called BRAVOFLY for four times, every time BRAVOFLY promised me to change it but no one actually did. My time is running out and it is really very urgent, so please help me , thank you so much, your work will be appreciated. Besides，the same situation happened to my friend WU WEI too (Please see the attached copy of her passport in my email ) . We book the tickets together，I hope BRAVOFLY can solve our problem at the same time, thank you!Planning an 18 day stay in Ireland over September/October. Never had to book an overseas flight before. I don\\'t really trust buying tickets from a 3rd party because they hide fees. I\\'m justand not having to worry about them.I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn\\'t open until midday we couldn\\'t get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet\\'s fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other wayVirgin and Sinapore have we sites which show you the actual seats and how they are laid out. I don\\'t want to be looking at someone across the isle from me and would prefer sitting side by side with my husband, although I know with flat beds this is not usually the case. Any ideas as to sites I can visit?As with many, worried about the implications of Mexicana\\'s potential bankruptcy/shut-down.So far the flight is not suspended/cancelled/reduced like many others.We\\'re thinking of winging it, and relying on expedia to re-book us if there is a cancellation or the airline stops operating. Any thoughts on consequences?( We found out that they charge $500 if we do miss the flight and have to book a late one...ouch..) Thanks in advance for any replies.OTB charged us £532 for the return flights. They paid Thomas Cook £420 for the same. The baggage charge was £19 each per journey. Total £72. They paid Thomas Cook £38 in total. In total, there was an increase/unearned profit of almost 30% . The moral - never ever use \\'On The Beach\" - not only that, they never pick up the \\'phone, nor do they give you an email address.Hi Despite all the negative feedback on the I decided it was worth trying to acquire one as I travel with Ryanair frequently.I flew with Canjet to St. Lucia, December 2010, Christmas Holiday. The temperature was very freezing that I and many passengers had to keep our winter coats on at all times. The flight crews would not do anything about it. As I catches cold easily, I was worried about my health and so are many other passengers that flew with me. I am a world traveller.(despite the very high altitude) at a comfortable level The Management even support each other. I, and I am sure other passengers as well had a very uncomfortable flight to St. Lucia. Please do not give anymore businesses to Canjet.Hi, Was the first time flying with this airline.  you could tell that they enjoyed their jobs! They were quite comical! The flights departed on time and actually got into both New York and Toronto, 30 minutes early! I would fly WestJet again.I have a friend who has cut up ALL his Credit Cards because he was always getting into problems with to much spending. He is always asked for a Credit Card. There is a fee for booking with a Travel Agent or at the Airport and I appreciate any comments or info you may have. ThanksHave they improved? I would say \\'yes\\'.  Obviously you don\\'t expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it\\'s quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn\\'t generate an instant but synthetic \\'have a nice day\\' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed responseHello, I am sorry for posting this in the air travel forum, but I have spent literally weeks trying to research this, calling everybody I can think of, only to be told to contact my embassy who does not take phone calls or give any advice.I can\\'t risk being denied and losing all the money I spent. Please reply as I am due to travel very soon. Thank you.tessyHi everyone, I know this question is noting to do with Cyprus but as your normally all so helpfull thought you might know. not the toilet side the galley side and wondered if these were ok, all legroom ones have gone, so thought this might give us slightly more legroom, any views. We dont normally pre-book, but after last year not sitting together we are this year. Thanks in advanceHi, LouShe will be taking hold luggage and a small backpack as cabin baggage. She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane, but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end. The baby is already very heavy and although can walk a bit, will not be able to walk long distances. She is too heavy Has anyone else had this problem? I was thinking of her using special assistance but that really for disabled passengers. Any other ideas would be gratefully received.hi,i\\'m a teacher so need to go during summer holidays so expect it to be more expensive but at the minute the prices are sky high. is there likely to be a jan sale or what is peoples advice for me in relation to flights? we simply couldn\\'t afford to go at the current prices. has to be flight only as we already have accomodation over there, my mum is in the disney vacation club!! thanks in advance!Made a telephone booking on Mon.10th Sept for flights to Auckland for 2, and up to now have not received my e- tickets. Have made several calls and sent e-mails, last one made at 13.00 today, received a reply informing me - should get tickets today by 6 pm. Starting to feel unnerved, any stories out there?up a journey for me,, should I need it which I don\\'t. With the others that would be extra. And BA includes two items of hand luggage. Moral of story, check before you blindly book with a Low Cost Carrier.Hello,They are only up until the end of July 2010 at the mo, and I cant wait to book! Thanks :-) I think they are trying to go for a record.t is an incredible deal but before I shell out any funds to them, Thanks., I will be on my own and a bit nervous about the change. Thankshttp://nyti.ms/ICNGGqj (I hope link works) IMO, it is going to take more than redesign to help both airports-there has to be major infrastructure overhaul including better road access and subway access. And then there\\'s the Port Authority of NY/NJ which is a whole other topic. I always try to fly into EWR if possible when going to New York.I booked a flight to a Central American destination early this year for a nice midwinter vacation with my husband. Well, the day of our flight, there was a major North Eastern snowstorm. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico\\'s fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So oh, by the way,----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that\\'s poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason. If there is any problem at all, even if it\\'s not your fault. you\\'re not going to get your money back no matter what you do. I\\'m out $1200 unless my bank agrees to reverse the charges. Edited: 2:07 am, March 11, 2014I have read postings about how airlines do not accept miles all the time. We are looking for an airline with a credit card that makes it easy to book a flight with miles. Any suggestions?ThanksHello everyone.  Thanks for your help :)Can anyone advise me on (or anal) .I take 10 tablets a day X 87 days . This is a lot of tablets in 30 boxes .

Thank you.Sent them a copy of my bank statement showing payment was made and have the stamp mark in my passport but Hello fellow travelers, I am wondering - since I\\'m still doing research on the country I\\'m visiting next year, when will the airfare be available? Eg. It\\'s too early at the moment since the only airfare available is up till Feb 2014.Has anyone ever had problems over I.D.? have put a new route on their website which will become the longest on their network,This route would probably be about 5 and a half hours flying time each way and would take up close to 12 hours for an aircraft to complete a round trip. Seems an awfully long route, is it really going to happen? Would be great if it worked out for them. It may mean flights as far as north-eastern Africa (Egypt sort of area) and the Middle East or even the Cape Verde Islands from the UK may become viable! Would be great if Ryanair could offer that!!!I have bought a plane ticket from JAL which is a ticket from kuala lumpur malaysia to japan haneda. However i need to fly from kuala lumpur to singapore and the plane is operated by malaysia airlines and from singapore to japan where the plane is operated by JAL.*The ticket is bought from JAL website which consist of these two flights*I cannot recommend this company enough.and has been an absolute diamond in all our dealings.

I think this connection is too tight but any advice (especially from anyone who has travelled to the States from LHR recently) would be welcome.Hi, I\\'ve read some horror stories about them but have heard that they have improved and now have newer planes. I\\'d like to hear of experiences and thoughts on them! ThanksI had the original eticket from my email inbox but no other information ie boarding passes etc so if you do decide to try and claim this should be the only thing you need to attach to the letter.

              "'Just to set the scene I have a fairly tall husband who likes to complain on long flights when his legs are hurting him In the past we have been lucky in getting the seat next to the exits with the extra legroom on scheduled flights on a few occasions I recall getting these seats when we asked politely at the check in desk Ideally we would love to get these seats when we travel to Bangkok economy  although I know there is no guarantee and after reading posts they can be allocated to passengers with elite status etc I believe these seats are only assigned by the airport check in staff on the day or at least this is what I thought I read on the Emirates website We have selected the next best seats for us through the online booking manager system My question is therefore this We already have allocated seats so as far as I can see the only extra thing that online checkin offers is that you dont have to have your boarding pass printed at the checkin desk Things that are putting me off are 1 Ive noticed over the past couple of years that because now most people are checking in online the queues for the online checkin desks are often actually longer than the queues for people who havent checked in online 2 Last year we had a 12 hour flight delay  the original plane had a problem and the airline then split passengers into two groups and people who had NOT checked in online were flown out on a much earlier plane than those who had checked in online  goodness knows whyMy family is flying from Hartford Ct to Honolulu in a couple weeks We have two short stops before we make it to the west coast The stops do not allow us enough time to grab a bite to eat Other than buying the food for purchase on the flightsI knew United did not have seat back TVs or a decent AVOD system so need some suggestions to keep my boy entertained He will sleep for some of the flight as it leaves Sydney at 4pm I was thinking of buying a portable DVD but battery life will get me 2 movies maximum Same battery life problem if i was to get Ipod touch or even with laptop So what other suggestions do you have for meHello  In the fall we had a two week vacation to Europe involved four United flights First got canceled ergo the second one we missed Took three other ones instead On the trip back two flights were planned Both got canceled even though they were confirmed about three times Had to take another airline back skipped last flight and took the train back instead Had paid for the overseas flight extra for economy plus seats and of course didnt get them since the flight got canceled and we flew with another carrier Paid 700 for travel insurance didnt see a penny Thanks UndineHi Last month I booked a ticket for my wife and I to Las Vegas travelling on US Airways from Israel to LV My passport is US and hers is Israeli I booked her ticket under the name shown on her Passport and Visa well use Jane DoeHowever shortly after booking the ticket So  But Speedbird recently linked me to an AA wikie which linked to the Flyertalk forum where I read about XPlats not getting upgraded on certain routes Plus we were on a direct which was only going to be 5 stickers instead of the usual 7 for that connecting routingso we figured we had no chance Checking the website the night before well within our 24 hr windowstill nothing But Wont get anymore free stickers until we fly 10000 which will definitely happen this year but yeah it was sure nice Im almost happy I figured we had no chance because it was such a nice surprisei fly with china airlines from Los angeles to taipei with connecting flight to jakarta almost 20 hours flight it was a very dissapointed experience from my 20 years flying experience im a travel addict i will travel at least 2 times a year to all over the world n i ve been used many airlines from asian airlines european even from arabian airlinesbut china airlines is the biggest dissapointment their ground staff are meannever smile

Portable laptop computer and a small tote bagam looking to I am arriving at 835 pm and the RGN flight is at 950pm I am worried about the connection times for me and the luggage in Hong Kong No other direct flights to RGN for another 24 hours and this trip is already long so any advice is welcome One element is that Dragon Air is a Cathay affiliate and they are all Oneworld Flying business class up to HKG if that makes any difference I had to buy the Dragonair part separately as the cost was prohibitive with AA when it was part of the original ticketHi Ive heard horrid stories abt flight cancellation delays poor service bad air plane conditions etc Well be taking a 6 hr flight from SFO to MCO Orlando with 3 kids Appreciate the feedback thks v muchHi can anyone help I have never travelled before or checked in online If you dont have your boarding pass its £60 for a reissue at the airport so dont want that to happen Tried customer services but can never get through ThanksWe are looking to book LGW to CLT soon We have flown US Airways to JAX several times recently which involved a change at CLT  Crazy or what Looks like Delta insteadi am having a problem finding web sites that have multi city flights thanksThe reason of this email is to explain an unfortunate situation me and other 10 passengers suffered at the Denpasar Airport on the 19 of December 2015 We arrived at the Denpasar airport 19 of December 2015 with the flight VA65 from Sydney Virgin Now we went to the transit Area in Denpasar and ask for Qatar Airways assistance Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers We requested assitance to the airport personnel but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight we had to do custom clearance get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport When we did the check in we were charged 200000 rp which I think is completely wrong 1 The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015 Denpasar Airport tax was included  as I booked my flight during Sept 2015 2 We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight Passengers in transit should not pay the 200000 rp So for the above stated and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice Another point to have in mind right now I am at the Denpasar airport again as a transit passenger I arrived from Doha with Qatar airways and I am connecting to Sydey with Virgin Virgin personnel was waiting for us on the transit counter of the airport of Denpasar we did the check in and we did not pay for anything So Virgin did his part on this situation and Qatar did notHi everyone A quick question  we have booked through BA to travel to Bali via Changi Were flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore but our connecting flight is on Jetstar and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi 12 hours we would like to make use of the transit hotel However as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one As far as I can tell both airlines use Terminal 1 My question is My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because checkin for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesnt open until several hours after our flight from London arrives If anyone could put my mind at rest Id be most grateful  thank youI have been a Life Member of Qantas Club for years but generally these days choose other airlines For all the smoke and mirrors Qantas is very hohum  ergo dull and boring After a series of serious inflight incidents the proud kangaroo has had a bit of PR disaster While Qantas has not had an accidentincident where people died tarnished is the operative word for them They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all Recently I booked with their subsidiary Jetstar Sydney  Honolulu return with business options Here the addons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included I have a cattle class SydneyBrisbane return with them as well and that has addon costs galore My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimers The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number absolutely a denial that such a booking exists A call to their customer service department took two days to get through It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message When I did connect I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile However the domestic booking is there Go figure With well over 400000 frequent flyer points Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway To sum up QantasThe benifits of the Premier Cabin are several Dedicated check in no waiting Complimentry drinks More leg room First on and off at your destination THATS it You are told you will get a choice of meals chicken OR beef is the choice Your luggage has Priority Hold labels fitted they mean nothing Extra film channels the whole plane got them When returning to the UK GGow my baggage ends up at Manchester The Premier Cabin has 49 seats  £300 per return trp which equals £14700 A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY FOR THOMAS COOK Then when you try to get in touch with them to talk about your grievances they dont want to know as they have your money and dont seem to care about customer service After nearly 2 weeks I am still waiting a response to several emails to them CONCLUSION Go on holiday with ANY ONE BUT THOMAS COOKWe flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport The flights were on time going over no issues with delays or connections The flight was delayed an hour coming back but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections lost bags etc The planes were lovely and service great The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back We had booked a while back when they had a 21 special 2 fly for price of 1 We booked our basic flights ex Chch Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight For the most part these were tiny changes change of terminal flights changing times by 510 minutes in our favour however one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland then a domestic flight to Chch We didnt have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get When we went to do this online we found that it would cost us 98 which we were prepared to pay plus 15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the 15 as it was not our choice to do that leg The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem I pulled out my cc to pay for the NaritaAKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that When we got onto the Gold CoastAuckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round the hostess informed us we each had 10 voucher for food This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZAustraliaHey Im going to Japan on the 24th of June for 5 weeks to summer school and I have stopovers in Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Seoul in South Korea before finally arriving in Japan Im only staying for around 23 hours during my stopovers and wont be leaving the airports My airlines are KLM for the flight to Amsterdam and Korean Air to Seoul and Japan and I only have one reservation number and paid for my whole trip on Expedia so I think my flights are all on one boarding pass but Im not sure Thank you in advanceHi there Mainly would like to know if they have personal and if so  Looks like the The route is SYD to BKK to HEL to VIE and vice versa Many thanksI flew to Stockholm with Finnair 3 weeks ago on arriving after 8pm I found my baggage damaged but no one around to report it to On flying back to London a few days later I went to report the damage to a Finnair employee in Stockholm I was told that she couldnt do anything  to report it in Helsinki where I would get my connecting flight back to London speaking to the Finnair employee In Helsinki I was told as I didnt have my case with me as it had been automatically transferred to the connecting flight that she couldnt help me  to report the damage in London when I had my case back in London I am then informed by the 3rd Finnair employee that I had been given the wrong information  that it should have been dealt with in Stockholm I was then told to speak to the baggage people at Heathrow who gave me an information sheet to email the company who deals with Finnairs damaged luggage with the photos  luggage tag I subsequently didnt hear from them so I called up to be told they couldnt help me  to call Finnair customer services After speaking to the 4th Finnair employee I am told to fill in the feedback form that was almost 2 weeks ago I have not heard anything or been asked for anymore information I will be flying again soon so any help is most appreciatedMy Christmas gift to my parents is that Im flying them from the US to Germany to visit me this summer However which are quite expensive now due to rising fuel costs  Also Ive yet to hear any good stories about any travel insurance company so any personal experiences would be much appreciated Thank you Posted at 0909 AMET Jan 10 2008 in International carriers USATodayHi Someone paid a deposit of 100 on my behalf without me agreeing to it and now At the risk of being hung drawn  quartered for saying this I have to say after our first flight with RA we were impressed Flew with RA to Malaga 3 wks ago no luggage issues very clean aircraft comfy seats good leg room  friendly FAs Yes we read  reread the T  Cs just in case  even took our own luggage scales ready for battle but no problems whatsoever Return flight from Barcelona with BMI Baby a couple of days ago also our first trip with themon a less than clean rather rickety plane not as impressive Sorry to praise RA but I thought in the interests of fairness I had to praise where praise dueHi I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline  from YVR to LHR Departed on time arrived at LHR 20 minutes early I paid about 100 extra for an exit row seat 28J and couldnt recommend this more The seat is located in the first row in Economy right behind Club World After takeoff they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here theres no one walking around to disturb you My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight If you cant afford Premium Economy this is a really great option Dinner was a choice of pasta with feta and tomatoes or chicken with rice and veggies I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty  by no means a five star meal but not bad for plane food The chocolate dessert was delicious After dinner service lights went out and it was time to sleep A word of warning  its extremely cold by the exits I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight In hindsight Im not sure why I didnt ask for an extra blanket  I must have been delirious with sleep Breakfast is served about an hour before landing It consisted of a fruit muffin yogurt and a box of raisins  Not very filling but oh well IFE was average  I only watched one movie before going to sleep The new releases were nothing to get excited about so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment BA85 from LHR to YVR My experience on this flight was similar to the above except this time I had seat 29K This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front and not over your seat mates It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR I also flew from LHR to BCN BA486 and AMS to LHR BA435 on their smaller planes Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration Theres no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights I dont know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights  Edited 1128 pm July 13 2015I am trying to fly from YWG Winnipeg to Delhi in August and recently discovered that there is a direct flight from YYZ Toronto by Air India everyday that would get us into Delhi before 1500h which is awesome I would love to take 2 flights instead of the 3 flights I thought we would have to take YWGYYZ somewhere in Europe  DEL The problem is the Air India flight NEVER shows up on ANY online search engine travel site like expedia travelocity etc etc etcwhy noti dont get it is the only way i can book this is to go to a travel agent JoI fly a lot for biz and pleasure and just got back from London to New York last week after connecting from Spain I have never been on a more unpleasant flight I was in economy class A 7 hour flight with a family of 4 behind me The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old The kids alternated crying screaming howling and seat kicking the entire flight Parents did nothing to stop this Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Juniors very soiled diaper right there in the seat From my vantage point I could both see and smell everything that was going on Absolutely vile Needless to say I was shocked Just before landing round  2 The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too A lack of class by these parentsHi  I travelled from Luton last year and their lounge allows you to serve your own drinks I prefer this way I am travelling from Gatwick on the 6th Feb 2014 Flown Singapore Qantas Cathay in the past with no negatives so do not want any surprises here cheers Happy TravelerHey all Im after a bit of advice from seasoned travellers We dont travel much but I think they had a sale around June last year If not I can just book with AA but would prefer direct if possible but not for an extra £250 pp Any help or advice much appreciated know that one should never go back and check the prices after a fare has been purchased but I did and saw that the fare had dropped by 250 since I booked the flights yesterdayFunds should be redeposited into my account within 710 days  Good to know I was researching 1 way fairs between jfk and London on kayakbut operated by British airways for 590But when I check the same flights on any other site it was over 1400they are all direct flightsi usually only use kayak for reaearchhave never booked with themThank youIm booking a last minute flight from Vancouver to Dublin for Christmas day and I basically have just US carriers to choose from as anything on an airline I like is double the price SoI will not be checking baggage so it does not matter if the airline charges for bagsWere travelling on a family holiday to the US in three weeks and I have only just realised that as someone born in the US I must enter on a valid US passport last time 6 years ago I was advised to take both but travel on my UK one and was never asked for my US one very The Embassy cant tell me this and have advised I wait until 3 days before travel before even contacting their emergency line Im despairing and were all franticDear Air France and fellow passengers The service I have received by them in the last 24h has been absolutely appalling After a cancelled flight I was made to wait for almost 4 hours to be attended at which time any options for rebooking has already left or were full Hence my morning meeting on 2311 will be missed and my prepaid car rental at MIA is lost I reschedule meetings for 4pm on 2311 assuming a 1225 landing After waking up at 5am I arrive at the airport to find that my 830am flight had become a 1020am flight no email or courtesy call from AF So another meeting to reschedule last minute and perhaps lost business Additionally the upgrade to premium economy I was promisedno longer the case today This is the absolute worst treatment by an airline I have ever received and I intent to pursue my rights as a passenger according to EC2612004 or other applicable regulations to ensure my losses and expenses are reimbursed Yours sincerely Bob VandedrinkHi there we are considering  The flight stops in Frankfurt on the way Ive seen some negative reviews The price comes up in euros but it is still a good deal Thank youHello I am ready to book my flight to Dubai and Thanks for your help As a regular traveller I am used to the usual airport customsimmigration lines at airports That is why I was so glad to hear Pres Obama himself proclaiming the wonderful advances in passenger processing at DFW for US Citz plus anyone travelling with ESTA Therefore 3 booths out of 28 were open 1hr later they opened 16 more Yes there were 6 international flights landing within 20 mintues of each other but in this day and age they must surely be fully aware of the number of passengers on each flight their nationalities and their exact arrival time  many hours in advance And to think we travelled via DFW in order to avoid LAX  not next time we wont Rant over Hi  and vowed never to fly them Now my company has booked me a one way ticket from YYZ toFCO I have offered to pay the difference to pay for the air canada flight on the same day but just in caseThanks TerryRecently chose the select your seats option with thomsons for our flight to rhodes in july was told my selection would become available 90 days prior to our return flight which was 18th april they emailed me with the seating plan which i tried several seats on the plane but just kept coming up seats unavailable because my party not sitting together which we were then phoned thomsons and they went on about flight numbers changing which was causing the problem and assured me that this would be solved by monday and as i am travelling down from scotland to manchester  thanks in advance Hi As information  Edited 1245 am March 30 2011due to my eye care professionals recommendation In a few months this will be my first time traveling with it by air  I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed However I now use exclusively Clear Care and if that does not make it through TSA I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed I am planning to travel to an Asian destination where there is almost no guarantee that I will be able to find the product for sale I wear the overnight orthoK lenses thus I do not own a pair of prescription glasses nor do I have any need for themHi all I was wondering if you have any tips or suggestions with booking airfares over the Christmas holidays I am ingor chances of flights dropping in price Reading forums already posted I will be sticking to purchasing directly from airline carriers To many dodgy and expensive travel agencies and third parties out thereHi  ThanksHello All My brother and I will be taking our first trip of hopefully many to London in May of 2010I have been a little trigger shy on this because I have read some not so great reviews about UnitedI cant wait to get those tickets in our handsHi Super Escapes want to charge me £68 to add 1 suitcase to the hold So far i cant get a clear reply or answer off either company easyJet say add it via manage your bookings but i dont have a suitable booking reference number But i dont want to pay £68 if i can book it via easyJet for half the price Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated Thank youAfter a few tense days of waiting for an outcomeI accidently entered my last name on my mothers reservation to Italy and the mistake was not caught immediately After reporting the problem via their website I searched the internet to find all kinds of horrible results to similar situations including having to repurchase the ticket without refund at the current going rate The current rate is now 500 more than it was a week ago I would like to thank Shirley from International Reservations for her diligent persistence in helping me to correct a name error Without her help I would still be worrying whether TSA would allow my mother to fly with the ticket on which I incorrectly entered my last name instead of hers Shirley was great and fixed the problem with no issue She was polite during the entire transaction and gave me updates along the way so I would feel comfortable on hold Thanks again for her help Also thank you to Dan from Internet Support for starting the correction processWith the rising cost of fuel the airline has found ways of reducing the fuel bill by reducing the weight it carries on its flights They will be shrinking the size of its inflight magazines from A4 to A5 size carrying less ice on flights and believe it or not encouraging staff to watch their weight  with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar But Ryanair are only following in the foot steps of other airlines  In the 1980s American Airlines claimed that they saved 40000 by taking out one olive from every salad in first class and more recently Japanese airline All Nippon Airways started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions  prefer business or premium economy

off and land at T2 in Sydney So Qantas in its wisdom or a sign of the economic times has closed the Qantas Club Lounge at T2 A lot of us pay 450 per year for a Qantas Club membership  if you cant fly Qantas because they now fly Jetstar the lounge in T2 was well worth it Qantas say oh just use the lounge in T3  well easier said than done  you have to go through security at T3 to get to the Qantas lounge ever done that at 7am in the morning then leave T3 and go through security again at T2 Qantas say they havent had very many complaints on this closure have you ever tried to navigate the Qantas web site to find a complaint form I did then was sent an invite to join the American Express® Qantas Corporate Card program  what Ill be happy to let Qantas knowThis is what happening just now and though I would share this with you After a terrible frustrating week of delays canceled flights etc etc traveling all over the UK and Ireland a friend of mine is currently sitting on yet another

and they have lost their slot and are at the end of the q Now I know the Captain may of been stuck in snow unable to get in butjust  Gota love em not to waste your time that they supposedly offer This was their response Your reservation is booked in V and T classes of service At the time of our research at wwwpricelinecom we were able to locate a lower fare of edited per passenger However the classes of service were V and T therefore we must respectfully decline your request I politely asked that they reconsider sent a screenshot from Pricelines website and even offered to help them find it because its still there and very easy to locate when I was given another copy and pasted response telling me to read their terms and conditions Ive read them several times Dear Delta please just remove the program all together if you dont want to honor it No one is making you have this program Dont waste our time  Now that Im researching it Ive yet to come across anyone who has been approved Ill definitely be looking at other options next time I fly not because of the lack of a price match but because of the awful customer service I have received Imagine if something really went wrong and you needed somethingI hope I am posting in the correct forum if not please pardon me My trip is 712 and 13 Venice via Milan 7141516 Dublin 717181920 London Anyway I have had a horrible horrible time

the US and not from within Europe so I really never paid much attention ThanksHi As information for any US passport holder or future applicant New passport fees will become effective from 13 July 2010 onward This is for all applications lodged on or after this date Remember if you use a passport acceptance office like a US post office or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices its the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix If you are eligible to and use regular US Mail for submission its the post mark date that will govern Note that the one of the biggest increases expressed as percentage is in the additional page insert fee which goes from free to 82 per insert added Heres the entire new fee matrix from the DoS Passport Services page travelstategovpassportfeesfees5079html If your passport is going to expire soon will have less than 6 months validity or you need to add extra pages this would be an excellent time to do so before the new fee matrix becomes applicable Travel SafeGday everyone Im sick of being charged top dollars for airtravel in this country australiaand looking for cheap flights from melb

tried to check in online the day before I was surprised that I had not requested an exit row seat nor made any seat request expecting to do that at checkin The airline had no way of knowing my state of health and physical ability apart from having flown TK three times previously in the last month none of these flights being in an exit row At Ataturk I mentioned this to a supervisor and she just handed me the boarding pass and shrugged her shoulders when I asked for an explanation Incidentally at online check in I wasnt able to change the seat allocation and by the time I got to Ataturk the plane was full so it was lucky I was ablebodied and that my ablebodiedness was not requiredHi Thanks for your commentsWe are flying to Orlando in 2 weeks for our last full family holiday as our eldest

the 767 We have been refunded the money for the one way but its more to do with spooling my daughters dream holiday My youngest is 8 is a big aircraft fanatic and is really upset and is now experiencing a negative before we have even set off It may sound petty but we only booked with Thomson because of the Dreamliner and Virgin was cheaperHello all  A friend of mine told me that a certain amount of seats on all flights will be 1999 each way Just wanted to know what time this special starts and any possible restrictions as I cant find any information on their website Happy travels all Hi there was wondering fi someone could help me out  When I travelled to New York from Belfast on Continental there were actual plugs to use and charge my laptop but aerlingus says they do not have these Therefore I looked on the apple website and they claim that my laptop can be used if there is a EmPower port available but I cannot see if this plane has it Would be really great if somone could help me out Thanks PatrickApologies if this seems a silly question Ive been on Ryanair many times but this is the first time I am booking a seat for someone else There are four people travelling Seats 1F and 1E will definitely be booked I then need to book two others on the same row Hope this makes senseHi Because I like to be over prepared and am flying with 2 kidsMight sound silly to some but knowledge makes me less anxious  Thank you Edited 156 am January 04 2016Hi  Me and my wife are With best regards   member of Star AllianceHi with my 70 year old mum as a birthday treatHi KIf I book tickets on the Delta website for a flight operated by Virgin it works out almost £150 cheaper than if I book via virgin Atlantic and approx £100 pounds cheaper than buying through Expedia  I havent travelled on a code share flight since I was a child I intend to travel premium economy if that makes any difference Thanks AlecHi guys I just wanna ask if someone has same problem like I do but I cant get anywhere It repost it on googledodocomausearchhtml… and thats it No way to get there Any ideas what happened Im quite nervous because its first time I will fly with these guys and this is not good sign Thank youHi we re flying from malta to barcelona and then to tenerife  as no liquids r allowed in d hand luggage i ve read u have to use a zipper bag but i cant understand how and why maybe someone has been through that before and can help me thanks for any info u can give meHi but prices at the moment are sky high when compared to what I got last February was doing a trial booking for August this year to work out some costs this is driving me crazyI have a 7am flight with Easyjet on a Sunday morning in September We will checkin on line but i have luggage Im guessing we have to be there by 530am at the latest Trying to pin down a suitable and affordable hotel in the area Many of the shuttles seem to leave at 6am or have a reviews of the earlier 515am shuttles being late So I got these free drink coupons in the mail from earning a free flight  I really dont think Ill want a drink that early but was thinkin it might be nice to have a bottle of vodka or rum to make a drink later As much as I have flown with SWA youd think Id remember how people get their drinks I have only ever ordered a pop and once I got wine which did come in the lil plastic cup Thanks On a recent trip October 2014 on the way from Madrid to Casablanca all five of our group didnt get their bag in Casablanca The staff were very rude and unhelpful My friends were expected to make there way out to the airport at their own expense to collect their bags Also No help was offered with expenses during the 3 days they were without their bags To make matters even more upsetting on the way back to Madrid they left mine and my wifes bags in Casablanca also I recommend you google reviewscomplaints about this airline before you plan your blissful holidaystarting in March 2011 Just wondering if it is best to buy a Round the World ticket or as we are not major planners we have a rough idea of the path we will take A bit worried if we buy a RTW ticket are we restricting ourselves For example Sydney to Singapore Thailand up through Vietnam to China across to India then to Africa up through Egypt across to do Europe North America and then South America and home QUESTIONYour thoughts and comments pleaseHi Flying BirminghamEdinburgh Oct 25th and can get outbound flight Want to come back Oct 27th but no flights as yet Thanks not sure whether to book outbound as a good price No contact us email on website just 10p per minute telephone number Many thanksDi xThis must be among the lowest in the worldWhen we flew with Air NZ they were provided but someone said they had flown long haul and not had them provided Thanks in advanceI could not cancer my reservations but I will never fly BA ever again Hi I fly from Belfast City  Heathrow with BMI then on to SFO with Continental flight operated by Virgin Atlantic I booked the Belfast flight and the SFO flight separately with BMI and Continental My question is I think I read that the 3 airlines concerned operate a code share agreement Thanks for any adviceI paid 8000 for flight insurance from Access America I had flown to Hollywood FL from NYC to be with my husband for Christmas while he visited his elderly father in the hospital I planned to fly back after a week Then my fatherinlaw died two days after Christmas Now Access America is refusing my claim This is outrageous Access America refused my claim because my fatherinlaws death was either known to you or likely to happen I had no idea he was going to die when he did or I wouldnt have made the flight reservations in the first place My husband and I are selfemployed so one of us had to get back to the business We couldnt both stay there for the days weeks or months he might have lasted When he passed away it became more important for me to stay with my husband Now Access America is telling me my only recourse is arbitration which involves a fee and court appearance  NYC NYI am from India and planning to visit Brazil for FIFA World Cup in the month of June i have been trying many website links of the domestic flights of Brazil like TAM GOL Avianca Azul and even used expediacom to book my flights tickets from Sao Paulo to Porto Alegre Porto Alegre to Salvador and Salvador to Sao Paulo I could select the timings by using a translator plugin in the browser as some websites are not in English language And when the payment options comes my credit card VISA issued from the Bank in India is not being accepted I have created PayPal account especially for such international transactions but this account is not acceptable by any of those websites aboveThank youhi Ive flown with thomson in premium before and loved it Just not sure about tc I believe the cabins are being refurbed from this may so Im just wondered about the overall experience with Thomas Cook  Weve booked the middle 3 seats right at the front of the cabin travelling with my hubby and our littleone whos 3years so Im hoping the space and entertainment will be easier for us Thanks for any advise Sarah On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330 Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats I reserved my usual aisle seat but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible no big deal to be honest However in my row was a mother and 2 children The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him now if hed been seated in business then fair enough even accounting for his rather rude attitude However he was seated in a centre seat behind me I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in He then became extremely rude at which point I reported him to the FA The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat Several hours later his young son looked at me and said  your the nasty bldy man who wouldnt move I guess that comment says it all really clearly such language shouldnt come from a 3 yr old child I have moved before to try and assist a family as long as its a similar seat close by then thats fine This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me Regards RickTheir customer service is terrible and deceptiveWhen we had to cancel a ticket they were very unclear about the fees and lead us to believe that we would have a 150 balance left over after canceling when in reality the entirety of the balance was absorbed by fees It left a bad taste in my mouth that they made an extra 25 on me canceling when the end result was me being left with nothing I would have rather been told there was no possibility of changing the ticket because of airline change fees were too high Getting a straight answer out of their customer service was impossibleI plan to travel from Mumbai to JFK via LHR in December The 9 and half hour BA flight from Mumbai reaches LHR at 710AM I have two options from thereon I am entitled to lounge access at LHR I plan to fly economyThe second one will allow me to relax a bit in the lounge However I am a bit worried that the 1000 AM flight would likely to be more full with more passengers connecting to it I sure like some empty seats near mineRecently had a brilliant short visit to Saigon Absolutely loved Vietnam However on arrival home locks on 2 pieces of luggage were quite obviously intentionally broken Plus everything inside was moved around There were 6 bags altogether but only 2 were broken into I figured it probably happened at Saigon as we checked in 2 hrs earlier but when we got home all the luggage was out immediately We havent yet noticed anything missing I made a mistake of leaving few one dollar notes in there which definitely was a temptation Dont put anything that can be tempting in your check in luggage even if it doesnt cost much eg costume jewellery accesories We wanted to change our original round trip from Phoenix to Columbus to a three legged trip from Phoenix to Columbus then Columbus to Milwaukee to Rhinelander then Rhinelander to Milwaukee to Phoenix Our original reservations were on Southwest Had to call customer service to change because our departure city was different but the agent was able to help me and we ended up with a 100 credit Frontier is the only airline to fly nonstop from Columbus to Milwaukee plus the only airline to fly out of Rhinelander The first time I checked the fare was 175 Due to circumstances beyond my control could not book it then Last Thursday ready to book fare was 458 After I recovered from my heart attack I explored other options and booked the lowest fare I could find Delta thru Memphis then Frontier to Rhinelander Knowing wed have to pay a change fee if we had to change the Delta flights Today I get an email from Frontier that the Rhinelander flight times have changed and wouldnt you know our flight from Memphis gets in at 420 and the flight to Rhinelander now leaves at 415 So now we have to stay overnight in Milwaukee Oh and the Frontier agents first response was to cancel our flights He didnt care how we got to Land OLakes Off the check the cost of renting a car for 10 days  and Hello everyone My fiancé and I are traveling to Maui next May to get married since Thanks So I called the call center and was told that they had no information about luggage allowance and that it would be printed on my tickets and even worse that I selected this allowance when booking This is crazy  Many thanks GaryWe are a couple have been together 10 years and will see each other 247 everyday for the 18 day trip  so there is no need to sit next to one another on the flight  Unless of course the seats we are in are better than the 2 window seatsThanksMy wife and I merged our North West World Perks miles with our Delta Sky Miles accounts Afterwards we found out that even if you have a recent flight with NW and your miles would not expire for quite a while the Delta expiration date does not get changed We are now facing a very short time to use our Delta Sky Miles or we loose them If we had known that we would not have merged them Just another sad case of loosing our favorite airline in a merger We lost TWA which for us was a great airline until American destroyed it in the merger they are very inexpensive for a direct flight but Ive never heard of them and reviews on their website are all over the place I will fly Turkish Air the entire wayI have never been through Istanbuls airport Flying soloThankschrisTheir latest ploy of charging for baggage to be put in the hold when the current hand baggage legislation size rules are very tight is a bit of a cheek Then you get the CEO pretty much admitting that he doesnt want passengers sleeping on his planes so he is able to get his staff to seel them as much duty freefoodscratchcards as possible With BA and other better quality European airliners reducing their prices I wonder if the middle class who have embraced Ryan Air will start being happy to pay a few quid more and fly with a bit more sophisticationI am going back to Chicago from Cochin  India I have a ticket to Chicago from Gulf Air stopping at Baharain and LondonThe layover at London is 15 hours I have a friend in London and my question is I hope anyone with a love of travel and have traveled for many years squeezed into the back can have this experience All you need to do is save up those Frequent Flyer miles for years and years of loyally flying the Star Alliance airlines in the narrow crowded seats and keeping a sense of humor knowing you are doing your favorite thing traveling to far away countries We will probably never again be able to afford to travel this way certainly not enough time to collect miles nor save enough moneyBUT  the memory of this experience on British Airways will last until the end of our days  I remember boarding in the back under the tail and walking up the aisle and using a pillow for a trayAhhh and now sleeping pods pajamas slippers 5 star meals top shelf spirits and the most polite incredible flight attendants obviously the creme de la creme Now we two mature people celebrating our 50th anniversary know what goes on behind the curtainIve been comparing airfairs and Aeroflot has always been the cheapest Ive avoided this airline for so long because everybody I know told me to basically avoid Aeroflot unless absolutely necessary Im looking for a decent ticket for my fly between North Europe and Tokyo The cheaper the better when it comes to price but flight duration is more important to me I just looked up and the fastest is with either Aeroflot or Finnair for this route But there is a huge price difference Aeroflot is offering oneway tickets for 13 of Finnairs price My dilemma is that other routs are much longer than these I dont want to have a layover in Continental Europe because that becomes a detour But Finnairs prices are more expensive than other airlines that offer flights from Europe to Tokyo Im debating if its safe to fly with Aeroflot Ive seen comments that say its not that bad any more But then again I hear horrific storiesThanksHello AmsterdamRio with KLM Boeing 777200ER  FrankfurtRio with Luifthansa Airbus A340300  ParisRio with Air France Boeing 747400 I will be travelling with 2 kids – 35 and 15 years old Thanks in advanceHope someone can help as murder trying to get through to Ryainairafter reading all the negative comments on Iberia I was dreading the trip we planned  we flew from jfk to venice madrid stop and lisbon madrid stop to jfk we left 1019 and returned last nite 1101 Let me say that the planes were spacious and clean food hard to believe better than other airlines and the crew on land and in the air were pleasant and helpfulWill KLM I get points but there is an extra stop in Amsterdam I have gone on Klm before and like the flight from Toronto to Amsterdam Austria Airlines come with the tour package eg Fairfx Date Sun 27 Feb 2011 125129 0600 13 hours late  the only positive was the polite and professional Frontier counter ticket attendant hit by a wave of frustrated  tired united passengers at 4am at the Denver terminal Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo  even though the ticket we received did show a flight  we were then told to see a United ticket agent  and that was in a different terminal  Well off i went  unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone  he proceeded to tell me  by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile  i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate  still not knowing whether we had a flight  The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client  2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation  after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate The agent was off the phone  looked at my tickets  reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight  go see delta  Off i went to delta again  different terminal again  I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United  At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it  the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER   After some enormous restraint I insisted she call  She told me to have a seat  finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation  I have no idea what that meant  shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification  we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate  c 9 then c 10 and then f 1  We were a party of 4  2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens  in the 13 hours it took  every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us  this was very stress full on them  we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ND  as Fargo was not our final destination  so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well  In Denver the night shift gave us hotel voucher  not used and told use to go to wwwunitedapprecitioncom for additional informationJust my luck Its my Daughters 18th today Had a meal planned to celebrate for ages now and my flight booked months ago Blooming heck I said or words t that effect what am I going to do now To top it off I forgot that they sent me a mail ages ago changing the flight to 1020 so not only have they cancelled I got up two hours early Not blaming EZY for the horrendous snow but I tried to call customer services at 0600 and was on the phone for 30 mins before giving up I wanted to see if I could change the flight to go to MAN then catch a train which you cant seem to do online only reschedule the flight or get a refund Anyway I have managed to get on KLM €220  but not until 2100 tonight There was a flight at 1500 but after procrastinating about what to do and hanging on the phone to Easyjet that quickly filled up as KLM also cancelled their morning flights to and from EDI Anyway will miss the meal but these things happen Never had a flight cancelled before due to weather but it would have to be today of all daysAt least EZY managed to let me know by text and email BEFORE I left for Schiphol By the way flgihts to Glasgow for the next few days were over €500 on KLM I only wanted a seat not an executive jet Moan over Friend  ThanksI flew with Easyjet last year for the first and last time We actually got as far as boarding the plane when the pilot announced that he would not fly the aircraft as he had an ear ache We were told that an alternative pilot could not be found and that we would not be flying out until the next morning We were put up in a hotel and given a letter stating that we were entitled to 250 euros compensation each under EU legislation On our return I emailed EJ requesting the compensation and a refund for our first nights accomodation in Spain which we had booked via EJ The hotel money was refunded butI sent a letter in March requesting it and have still heard nothing Its like getting blood out of a stoneDear Readers I recently June and July2010 travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 1611 and 9 We visited France Greece and England I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure The first two flights were uneventful However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 1605pm Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 1900 and check in closed at 1820 Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 1755pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 1800 I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in By the time I got to the counter it was 1818pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had nonrefundable accommodation and other paid activities in London I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage 1821pm by her watch the flight had closed there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 1910 I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 1840 She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian 355700 I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25 refund The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under There website would suggest otherwise I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances I will keep you all posted

flew to Phoenix from Toronto last week This was bar none the worst flight I have ever taken It was tighter than any Air Transat that Ive flown The seats are so close together that even I was uncomfortable at 5 feet tall My husband is over 6 feet and he was miserable I fortunately was in the aisle seat but the couple occupying the middle and window had a 2 year old on their lap I felt very sorry for them The wife couldnt even get her purse out from under the seat until we all stood up I took out my tape measure and measured the distance from the front edge of my seat to the seat in front It was 7 inchesThere is also no TV on Rouge so you better have an IPad or be prepared to pay 10 to rent oneIve used Opodo many times but never againTHEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME £300 EACH PLUS £25 So £625 I will never ever use Opodo again  and I travel a lot Cheatersother than with Air Pacific Im very flexi with dates and was getting frustrated with prices so did some searching and surely it cant be taxes etc as you complete the same 2 flights and with the dollar at the moment 1 for 1 it cant be thatsince there is a partition between seats 7E and 7F and the next class All seats are still open

feelings that I did to check it outThanxGetting ready to book our annual business class trip from Miami to Rome which was also greatLeaving an overnight for connecting on a separate ticket Now  in the past with very mixed resultsonce pretty good and once with awful service and this year have the option of booking them nonstop from MiamiHave checked Airlinequality but did not see anything recent and would rather pay a little extra for BA or Virgin if Alitalia service has not improved I know the opinions of Alitalia justifiably so have not been positive on this forum but am hoping that there might be signs of improvementHi which means it will have 4 months left before it expires I know that I can get into Australia as the passport just needs to be valid for the duration of my stay 2 weeks but Thanks I have read a few articles saying they are having one fixed price for all year round so would bring the price down in high seasonHi  Im feeling really anxious about getting my connecting flight Thank youHi  Anyone know on the day of your flight regardless of flight time I like to spend time in the departure lounge just people watching and chilling out before my flight last time we flew with First Choice we were able to check in 5 hours before flight I know that is some peoples nightmare but Its all part of the holiday for me p Been to LCCT a number of times but never to KLIAI know its a 20 minute taxi to LCCT and considering if I should just take carryon on the first flight I usually travel light and can probably shove stuff in carryon Ive booked a seat towards the front for a quick exit  Its no biggie if I miss the connecting flightHi as the online guide is still showing SeptemberOctober Many thanksBad publicityresults Great news  Our flight is on Feb 1st and we have gone from a 319 to a 767 and are now on a 77L No more rouge at least not on the YYZBGI route for some flights I havent done a lot of checking but I noticed equipment changes from early Dec to end of Feb for now If you have a flight in that time period check your seats We havent been notified yet but I did see that our seats are not blocked out and I cant change seats online Guess thats a call to Air Canada To those of you who helped us get Air Canadas attention by expressing our displeasure through CBC CTA and the Competition Bureau as well as here and Flyertalk  Thank youThanks Im so worried about fitting my stuff in the overhead compartment since they dont have underseat storage in first classHi on this weekend i went last nov with 30kg baggage for economy now  Thank you My plans are were to travel to and from Spain on both dates Typically information here in the UK is not readily available with the media rather concentrate on a pretend politicians speech I am also aware of potential baggage handler strikesnot so worried about themEven First class is just regular old leather seats they have stateside not I have just paid a fortune to treat my wife on a super trip TaHey Jus a quick quetion  ThanksHi there  and chose the LowFare option with no extras Just the basic cost I then realised the dates clashed with work plans This cost me a business class upgrade on my next flight I contacted them they deny it I went through the process again and kept recods of the booking process and id does not warn you EVA say they tell Ebookers that they have to warn customers they dont if they are then it is hidden and I cant find it In essence they are conning people so be warned The response from Ebookers and EVA was totally poor I am now flying Emirates again and will never use Ebookers again They are not ABTA bonded either I found out as a result of this so again BE WARNEDMy husband and I are planning a trip to Amsterdam and Paris in Sept 2013 We can be flexible with our dates and we were thinking of traveling after Labor Day We plan to book roundtrip tickets on the Thalys train to travel between the 2 cities We appreciate any input that those experienced travelers can provide Thanks Im guessing this is to start aligning the fleets with Continental ThanksHi  ThanksI need to be able to lie down during the flight I am a UK national thanksHi there As we all know regularly airlines have offers of companionfares fromto certain destinations such as book 2 and pay 1 or book 2 and one gets 50 pct discountetc  Ive never seen a bookingengine come up with these fares as these searchengines are not programmed to list them in a query Maybe someone has other resources to search for these offers Thanks very much for your replies WikiHi everyone I booked a separate seat for my infant 15monthold and Im confused about the baggage allowance Thank youThey stopped flying out of Kona days before our flight They did not contact us and when we got to the airport we found a phone at their counter and were told we were pretty much out of luck They had not made alternate arrangements nor could they help We did not have the credit card wed used for purchase and were told to call when we got home and theyd refund our money We specifically asked if we needed to do anything else and were told all we needed was the credit card Now that were home theyre saying we need to return the paper tickets that the other person was wrong I find if ludicrous that they strand us and then try to shift responsibility to us for their mistake We dont have the tickets so were supposed to talk to corporate Weve left messages 3 times now and no one is calling back The only phone number on the website is to reservations and they will send a message that goes unanswered  Avoid Avoid Avoid Without the board I think I would have waited and maybe payed simular or more but with stop overs and not on such a nice air planeIve just been looking at a package with Jet2 over xmasnew year to Servigroup Venus where we have stayed many times I got the price back and had a quick chat with hubby and we decided to go for it and book Im so angry I had a live web chat with their advisors who more or less said it boils down to supply and demand on flight seats and hotel rooms I dont buy that not in such a short space of time Well Im sorry Jet2 you can stick it  Edited 938 pm August 04 2014British Airways has refused to reimburse us wife and I for expenses we incurred due to their cancellation of our flight They offered 150 travel voucher each Our costs are 47044 We arrived at LHR at 10AM on May 24 2013 BA advised that all flights were now canceled until 4PM That meant our 3PM flight to CPH was canceled We stood in line at BA Customer Service for ten hours along with hundreds of others Customer Service only opened 4 windows As the hours crawled by  tempers flared We got to the window at 8PM No flights available this day nor the next day  that would get us to CPH in time for the evening sailing of our cruise ship We agreed to an 10AM standby for CPH and a alternative code share routing that would get us close to the port where the ship would be on the second sailing day We spent the night wandering Heathrow Airport and retrieved our checked luggage Not much sleep Next morning  no luck at Standby Rushed to the alternate plan  and flew up to Manchester UK Then  rushed to another terminal to partner Lufthanza for a flight to Munich Germany From there Lufthanza toHamburg  where we arrived at midnight of May 25  on a weekend night  without a hotel reservation Taxied to a hotel very lucky and got a few hours sleep May 26  off to the train station took train to Rostock them Sbahn to Warnemunde Hurray  that is where our cruise ship was now docked We made it  No Thanks to British Airways  to whom we had submitted all our documentation And  to be clear about all this We are requesting Nothing for the Ten hours we futilely stood in line for the stress and aggravation for the no sleep no food at the Heathrow airport Back in October I purchased a RT ticket on KLM web for a trip in March 2014 to Entebbe Uganda As part of the ticket I paid the fee for Economy Comfort seat for 4 legs JFKAMS AMSEBB EBBAMS AMSATL Since October Ive routinely checked my itinerary online and up until yesterday everything was in order Yesterday I looked at the seat map and the flights appear to be very full Im concerned that if my seats have been resold or given away I will be out of luck Its not about getting a refund if that happens I really want those seats 24 hours of flying is tough but the KLM Economy Comfort product makes the trip much more pleasantWe followed all the guidelines and wrote requesting compensation for the 4 hour delay Thomsons declined stating it was extra ordinary circumstances Basically the flight from Majorca was delayed because the flight into majorca was delayed due to ongoing planned roundworks near to the airport causing some staff and passengers to be late for the outgoing flight These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staffpassengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time The flight was also n a Sunday evening so this should have not been as much of a problem as it would have been at peak traffic times After they declined my daughter wrote to the Spanish aviation authority and they agreed and advised compensation should be paid to the amount of é400 per passenger Thomsons still refused and have refused to answer any further communication She did all the communication via the online form  should we send in one last letter by post or should we proceed to the small claims court and in our opinions do you think she has a good chance of succeeding with the compensation claimIm currently looking to Both and while AA is slightly cheaper I was just wondering if it was worth the saving Basically  Any advice would be appreciatedI wasnt sure what forfum to post this to so i hope I can get an answer here I believe there is a site maybe google where Well let me say what i am looking for I am going to 5 countries in Europe I was hoping to look up things to do restaurants etc and plot them on a map for myself There are a lot of preset things with peoples suggestions on the net but would be cool if i had just the stuff on there that I wanted so i can plot out my daysThanksOn arrival at the airport she was told she needed an Esta form before she could book in As she was only in transit at Washington airport and not leaving the terminal she was not aware she needed one Please be aware that you will not be allowed to travel without one She did eventually obtain an Esta number from the internet site and just managed to catch he flight but it was very stressful and time consuming She had a connecting flight from Washington to Ottawa with a two hour time span Please be aware this is not enough time to negotiate customs and immigration and get to your next boarding gate if you are travelling through Dulles airport Luckily the Wasington to Ottawa flight was delayed or she would have had to spend the night in the airport They also lost her luggage Hi  Ive booked a flight to the UK next year and have seen some complaints about the removal of foot rests in Emirates planes and uncomfortable seating on long haul flights Id like to hear the experience of anyone who has flown with Emirates recently thanks SueNO Economy Plus at reservation only on day of departure So that means they are trying to sell the seats to one time fliers instead of reserving for those who have almost 50k miles Also taking away one bag at checkin But Hi guys i really need themwaiting to hear from youHi there I booked a holiday through Thomascookcom for my wife and I to fly to Kenya in October This was scheduled to be flying with Monarch Airlines  Having looked at the Monarch Airlines website  all passengers flying to Mombasa are allowed a baggage allowance of 35kg PER PASSENGER If you booked Premium Class this went up to 45kg PER PASSENGER Ive been in touch with them and they refuse to budge Ive since cancelled my holiday with them and booked through Cosmos and got exactly the deal I was after 3 weeks in Kenya to look forward to and 45kg of luggage each This will enable us to take extra clothing to distribute among the local population as we did in 2005 Dave HillI booked a flight with Travelbag online website and entered full payment details only to receive an email response that Your reservation arrangements are now being finalised and you will be contacted by a consultant either by email or by telephone within the next 72 hours to confirm your arrangements Ridiculous to wait for a flight booking for 3 days prices change every day its either confirmed or you book somewhere else There is nothing in the booking process that suggests this will be the case though on later inspection there is something embedded in the TCs I emailed and also tried to call the support line to find they are only open 11am to 5pm Called the next morning and got bumped to a voicemail Still waiting for an email or call back for a conformation or refund  Its quick no waiting butI reckon its just another form of fund raisingcurrently in Palma Spain and have unofficially been told they may have to wait till Monday for a return flight  Recently I was on a full flight Various nationalities were represented and an American couple was giving the flight attendant a really hard time about nearby passengers who smelled bad They had angled their air vents toward said passengers thus in turn causing them to complain Despite Americans culture of bathing deodorant and perfumes I once read that North Americans smell bad to Asians Who knew Manners odors demeanors all are culturally different and possible offenses So I learned something new  In the end we are all responsible for our own comfortJust curiousI was a little surprised as it seems so far in advance more than 24 hours I would think they would get another crew I dont think he is happy coming home so late at night before a work day but they wouldnt let him change to the earlier flight Not much anyone can do reallyHi all Im trying to plan a trip to Exuma The only problem is my husband will go wherever I book his only requestdemands are it has to be a non stop flight and he requires business class  We live on Long Island and My travel dates are flexible so no worries there Im even willing to drive to a different airport other than jfk if necessary within reason  Thanks in advance for any suggestions We are flying into T4 with Malaysian at the start of the evening rush hour and would like to rest for an hour or so before crossing London  We also noted that most seemed to be open mornings only presumably for passengers off the red eye needing to recoever It seems easier to take a break at Heathrow than to try and find a refuge at Paddington until the tube clearsI recently flew with Thomson and would never do so again I flew with one checked bag at a meagre 20kg and my usual hand luggage bag on wheels All was perfectly fine on the way OUT hand luggage was given a cursory glance and declared to be fine but coming home was a different story The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before even on the Thomson flight out I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag Upon reaching the desk I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small handluggage sized bag ofwait for it€133 The staff were rude dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks This obviously only applies on your return flight where you have no other option of leaving stuff and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood I felt bullied and was reduced to tears During discussion I was told my flight was completely full  it was not I was also told if I didnt pay up the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk really There were other people queuing all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes thus saving myself €133  PS credit to the amazing cabin crew staff who looked after me on the return flight  i could have hugged you all for your kindnessIve been reading reviews over the net about HA and PAL Hawaiian Air has way cheaper airfares for MNLSFO but at the same time Ive been reading on some negative reviews from people who took Coacheconomy flights w them As for PAL their airfares are way up although I have had no bad experience when flying w them Its the price difference thats making me think of trying HAs serviceThanksLong story short have fallen for a girl who lives near Seattle WA and with the exorbitant price of flights to and from the US really I need help getting there Tickets for an 18 hour connecting flight with a stopoff in Pennsylvania on comparison sites come out as £500 which is just ridiculous considering and Icelandair who do fly from Reykjavík for a well priced direct flight pose the problem of getting out to Reykjavík and getting home from Reykjavíc  Im not an experienced flyer but can get to pretty much any airport in the UK if it saves me some money Thanks Edited 1209 pm March 05 2014 Last year I booked rather late and the prices where much more reasonable than Im seeing right now Michael PS Im traveling from Seattle to Austin TxHi This fall were flying on Air France from Los Angeles to Barcelona connecting at CDG then returning a few weeks later out of Venice to Los Angeles connecting at CDG While I understand that most flights within Europe do not allow you to preselect your seats We were able to select seats for the international portion of our return trip but not the outbound Can anyone help me figure this out please It is our honeymoon and weve purchased Premium Economy tickets Were really hoping to sit togetherand not in the middle of the 4seat row Thank you for your adviceHi They seem to have the flights to Tenerife Fuerteventura etc on sale already but none to Lanzarote from Cork Thanks Here is a copy of a letter I sent Cheapoair I am trying to have the police in New York file criminal charges They say I have a credit for 1833 but wont let me use it 82907 I am a physician working in Walnut Creek California I bought 11 62006 three United Airline tickets 1833 visa receipt is attached from Cheapoair internet site located in New York to fly from San Francisco to Cancun on January 20th 2007 Due to changes at my job I cancelled my flights well in advance of the departure date I was told I would now have a monetary credit minus a 100 penalty per ticket that could be used for one year I called and reconfirmed this numerous times I have been trying to make new reservations for over three months now At first I tried to use the credit to go to New York see emails now I have been simply trying to rebook my original itinerary SFO to CUN Every representative tells me I have a credit for 1833 and that they can make me a reservation but when I go to book the flights they say they have to talk with their booking department and will get back to me They never do I have cell phone record of hours of conversation time I have also sent numerous emails including a final warning that I would be filing a criminal complaint —both promised repeatly they would get back to me and never did SincerelyAny domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair operating under the British Airways banner BAComair has a “policy” it happened on both of my flights of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding as “the cabin is full” Don’t do it I did and had a phone stolen from my bag When the crew approached me at the door I asked them if they would stow the bag on board meaning in the cabin They said they would Instead I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables minus one from the carousel in the terminal To add insult to injury my bag was well within the regulation size it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker on the return trip and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checkedin luggage Had I not been so sleep deprived after a long international flight I might have been more circumspect when ambushed by the crew BAComair has not responded to any of the three emails I have sent them So much for me being accommodating My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville FL We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip it was amazing to experience the difference in service The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat fresh blankets pillows and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings The entire crew was dressed very sharply smiled and actually thanked us for flying with them They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs Every flight on AA that weve taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crewsit is common place on AA It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable On each leg of the trip our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutesI am traveling from 09082016 from Schiphol Amsterdam to Hong Kong till 15082016 and will visit Shanghai till 20082016 From there I traveling back to Amsterdam I take my son 16 years with me on this holiday and in Hong Kong I will visit my cousin Greetings    Email Hey all Ive only just started watching the internal flights and the next cheapest is 100 more Im only asking as wondering should I wait till after Christmas I havent been monitoring the flights and will jump on it if its good Thanks very muchFlew AMS to ALC yesterday After take off I kept hearing a high pitched squealyelping noise coming from below my seat Now I didnt have a very hot curry the night before so knew it was not me I began to think there was something wrong with the plane Airbus 319s can sometimes make strange noises Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely Turns out that they You wouldnt think a little dog could squeal so loud It wasnt really a bark more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making perhaps he was immune Give me a screaming child over this little begger any day Today Ellemay wrote “I however like Qantas and apart from a few bad times mostly I find them to offer an excellent serviceespecially after you try some

and noticed the CCTV monitor showing the luggage being unloaded onto the belt which carries it up to baggage reclaim Very interesting Hey Guys im thinking of flying with them later this year from Australia to the UK and just after some general feedback on the airline Thanks in advanceI travel on Firefly the budget airline under Malaysian Airlines for the convenience of flying out of Subang Airport Recently I opted for the taxi booking to add on to my travel booking from the Firefly website Let me tell you  NEVER opt for this The airlines charged me MYR6 and it is really for no good reason and it was not explained clearly in the website I was under the impression that for my convenience I could book a cab to get to the airport and this was the cab fare It is not It is merely to have the cab company call you to ask whether you need a cab Which you can do for free on your own So in addition to the MYR6 you pay to the airlines you will need to fork out the metered fare plus MYR10 because you booked the cab as opposed to flagging it down at a cab stand Do not get cheated by Firefly by opting for this taxi service We were going to book WT and we have enough BA miles to upgrade to Club World for one leg of the journey When I last checked about a month ago most dates were available but we wanted to hang on a few weeks to spread out payments flight to Chicago just booked and paid for so held fire and were about to book when the news came through regarding the changes Just wondering  Same with binoculars We are planning on viewing a space shuttle launch and want our binoculars with us Must I check them in to We have had items stolen from our luggage so Im not real keen on checkingin valuable itemsPrinter broken wants to spend some time in Dubai on her way to Thailand She is planning 9 days for Thailand Please advise if she should increase the duration of her Dubai trip Many thanksIm taking my first trip to Europe in March and about a month ago flights were priced at  817 from to TPA to MAD Now theyre  910 I think I should have booked when I first looked My question for all of you who travel from the States to Europe frequently is I know they could also rise but Im not sure what a normal price would be I know its a crap shoot but Id like your advice on what youd do Thanks in advance for your helpIts companies like DialAFlight Ive tried them a few times to see what deal they can offer on line it looks good but once you phone them the deal never seems to exist They quoted me £850 to Bangkok Crazy I managed it for £580 myself for Christmas timeI have recently had cause to get in touch with them to change my booking I had to wait 35 mins for the call to be answered and at 10p per minute not a cheap call Once I got through I was told the server was down and I would need to ring again the following following week as they dont open Sunday I rang in the week and waited 28 minutes for my call to be answered booking changed received invoice via email but the details were incorrect I wrote to them and got nothing back and had to ring again on Saturday after another 22 minute wait my call was answered I asked for the booking to be corrected the operator assured me all was now correct  to date I have not yet received a corrected updated eticket which means only one thing I have to ring again as we fly to Greece in 12 days The thought fills me with dread One thing I can be certain of it didnt take them this long and this many goes to get it right when they took my booking and the paymentBecause they are 14 and 17 and they need tons of food and get hungry very easily and I feel like paying 100 for this service is just too much I mean the airport is super easy to get around and there are signs everywhere they have traveled a lot so they are very familiar with the transiting process  this should be an optional option for parents that dont trust their kids Im sceptical until they get any A380sHi Is one better than the other Which one can travel the farthestThanksI have booked a weeks holiday with on the beach and they have informed me I need to check in on line prior to travelling Apparently on the ryanair website you can only check in 7 days before unless you pay extra for allocated seats As I dont need allocated seats and dont want to pay extra It says theres a charge if you dont print off your boarding passes thanksI am a Canadian citizen travelling to US In total the fee are 11822Quick question it does not have a chip in it as i beleive chipped passports didnt not come in when i renewed my

StanstedSXF but this time we are flying from heathrow to Tegel with GermanwingsI checked the website and it mentioned only 1 piece of hand luggage with max weight of 8kg However when I called the

and had experience of taking two pieces through Thanks in advance Hi all Im a US citizen going from Newark to Santiago Chile I have a 14 hour overnight layover in Panama City airport and since Im young and travelhardy and poor Ive just decided to suck it up and stay in the international terminal reading and getting some work done My only concern is that here and elsewheresomehow go through some kind of customsimmigration or  Will anybody actually check up on how long Ive been in the airport if I never try to enter the country I will be checking a bag all the way to Santiago aka not picking up in Panama Thanks Edited 948 pm July 19 2013I recently booked Ryanair flights for my husband and his friend When I began the online check in as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online As the hotel was booked we had little choice but to pay the £110 Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page I believe this is what happened to us It also appears their terms of contract may be considered unfair So I intend to sue them in the county court and Hi all I am travelling from Dublin to Seattle via San FranciscoI am travelling with a young child so wouldnt want to make them go through immigration again took almost 2 hours last time Thanks in advanceHi In all my past travels Ive always been on a single carrier from A to C via B so for online

journey and nip off to Santiago for a bit So I googled Cuzco to Santiago and the best fare I got around 700 was going a tortuous route via Lima Iguazu Falls and Sao Paulo  more expensive than flying on to Easter Island Out of curiousity I checked what aIm at the early stages if planning a trip to California from UK Looking to  Any advice greatly appreciatedHello was just checking flights departing from Heathrow On Saturday 20th Aug I noticed a  Hi hope one of the Thomson experts out there help on this  It doesnt clarify this on the website as far as I can see I need to buy a ticket

customers We have flown this route before Washington Dulles to Heathrrow Last time I booked  5 months in advance  FOUR DAYS after I booked British Air lowered the fare by 40000 EACH Unbelievable I would preferably start with Qantas to leave and return to Australia but QF is not essential I want to know a year in advance so I can book work leave dates  when does the price triple And yes no

afford to pack any of it in my hold luggage because its mainly electronics valued at £500 ThanksHi eg deodrant and hairspray thanksHis Dad will be meeting him at the other end but he will be flying solo otherwise  After reading some of the posts I now realise this was not the best idea  and that my options were Accept a schedule change and they would request this with the airliner Apply for a refund subject to approval Most of the emails have been in poor english and a lot just have absolutely no responseI know they do not have the same reputation as EasyjetRyanair but  I fly from Birmingham if that makes any difference I shall soon be travelling from London Heathrow to Hong Kong in British Airways WT on an Airbus 38080 Hi I usually travel with Easyjet so am used to filling in the information on their website Where can I fill it in if travelling with Ryanair I have heard that you now add all the details when checking in online instead of having a separate page to fill in whenever you like However I thought that API was required at least 48 hours before the flight time yet Ryanair allow you to check in up to 4 hours before the flight leaves so how does this work Is there a wellhidden API option somewhere that I have missed Many thanks in advanceI am booked on SWISS Airlines from Rome to Zurich in Economy Their website says Economy passengers can have one carryon bag Period I booked this using United miles and SWISS Airlines as a partner airline I know on United you can have one carryon plus one additional personal itemVisionaries are building everything from sexy furniture to rainforest hotels out of airplane parts Its amazing what they can do with the old planes Some creations are very ugly others are very creative and beautiful cnngocomexplorationsplaygalleryhowdead… TommoI am quite doubtful about this Looks like I have to rush to disembark from the plane and run to embark on the next plane They make their money on extra charges that are not necessary When booking they charge you for delivery of paper tickets which are then not required and no refund is given They then say they are waiving the charges for substituting etickets You have not notice of this when making your flight reservationsWhy do budget airlines like Air Asia try to rip people off I am booking a ticket to Europe and I was going to purchase through cheapoair or cheap tickets but after reading the reviews I chose not too  TIAWe are planning to use Iberia from Memphis to Chicago to Rome I understand that all Iberian flights use Terminal 3Hi We are planning a trip to the US and will be flying sydney to la with virgin We have enough points to get myself my partner and 3 year old return in business but Im worried it might not be a good option when flying with a child We recently booked with Emirates a full paid 1st class return ticket from Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai The ticket was issued in Hamburg Germany On our return leg  Hi i am flying with Air Canada partly operated by Air Lingusive never traveled this way beforeso  I will be buying the ticket online via a third party to travel with Air Canadait states Air Canada ac9054 for the

luggage all the way through Thank youI am going to go with 1 RyanAir 2 BA 3 United 4 Qantas 5 GarudaIve tried searching but cant seem to find the answer ThanksWe fly from terminal 3 I know it will be expensive but I am travelling with my elderly Dad so want the carpark where it is only a short walk from the car into the departure lounge Help in identifying this would be usefulWe are traveling Korean AirHi I am a Diamond stratus person on Delta I have flown on their partner airlines Air France and KLM several times over the last few months Every occasion I have been treated poorly They simply do not recognize the status of Delta Frequent Fliers I would suggest you be aware of this we found cheap price from montreal canada to houston usa from the website below I usually use virgin but there is a big family of us going and the price is a lot cheaper with TC any advise thanksI have never used Priceline or any 3rd party booking site I normally fly for work or well planned in advanced vacation However I need to make near last minute reservations for 3 people I tried googling the answer but appeared it was outdated postingsHi All and was rather annoyed by the big colourful advert for National Express on each one Anyway I have printed in black and white rather than waste a huge quantity of coloured ink on those ads They still look good quality but for peace of mind  By the looks have things I have still used half a gallon of ink on those poxy adverts They should make these things as economical as possible to print outWe was booked to fly home from PRGEMA at 2155 on the 14609 At 2300 we was told by leaflet it was cancelled due to crew out of hours It did not leave East Midlands We was all put up in a airport hotel with breakfeast And it stated we will fly out on PRGEMASTD at 1120 the next day 15609 On getting up we went to the airport at 800 only to find this flight cancelled as well We was told to report back at 930 when we was told there is a plane coming from Luton for us and we will leave at 1330 We left at 1415 over 16 hours late on what we was told by easyjet cabin crew as a rescue flightor am I p against the wind So this is probably a dumb question but It says A4 paper on their website and I know they are sticklers for rules but Im hoping 85x11 will be ok since I dont even know if you can get A4 paper in the US I guess I could try to print the boarding pass in France or Poland but Id rather print it here before I leave since I paid for a seat just so I could I dont think A4 is exactly 85x11 inches thoughThis might be an inappropriate question to ask on this forum but Im not sure where else to post it  and my family and I cannot figure out a decent solution to the problem Here it is and money is not the problem Sometimes these gifts are quite bulky and as I travel lightly almost always without checked luggage and usually with just a backpack they never fit into my luggage On one occasion I ended up checking my backpack to bring the present on board as a carryon on another occasion a family member mailed me the present and didnt tell the giver that she was doing this Ive kind of had it and let s say  Thanks I have an international departure tomorrow I am planning a trip of Gainesville FL Miami  New York City I only need to stay in Miami for one morning but I must go there I see the funny point is that purchasing an one way ticket from Gainesville to NYC via Miami is way cheaper than purchasing a multicity trip However there is no suitable time as transferring time is too short Thank you very much Edited 1029 am May 04 2014 I understand the jet lag on the London to KL leg is quite bad I am worried that if I go to sleep I may not wake up for the flight home Alternatively would it be an option to go into KL for the day Have been there before so am familiar with the airport etc Just dont want to miss that homebound flight Thanks in advanceAfter reading up on the Internet and been unreliably informed by our travel agent that our names being transposed on our etickets ie first name as your surname and last name as your first name we decided that it should not be a problem Turned up to check in and were not able to be checked in on a virgin flight to bali from auckland Apparently Virgin cannot alter the booking only the travel agent who is of course was closed at 4am can The only option was to purchase another ticket We made it in the end but our ticket home has the same problemso trying to sort that now Hi Folks Icurrentlywhere I intend to do stopovers on the way there and back Current best option by far is Austrian Airlines to Tokyo via Vienna However which leaves very little room  having never been to Vienna airport or flown with Austrian AirlinesThere is an alternative earlier flight to Vienna but unfortunately its at 6am which means no sleep an expensive transfer to the airport and a 4 hour wait at Vienna which significantly lengthens the flight So no a very attractive alternative all round Any thoughts appreciatedWere of to Oz next December Some friends of ours are hoping to come too but ThanksI have flown direct via Aer Lingus but am curious about flying BostonLondonShannon but so far I have only done 3 of the minimum 4 BA metal flights required to requalify my flights having been mostly on AA Need advice asap my flight is tomorrow  May 4 I have horrible nerve pain in my feet and typically need to apply frozen gel packs that wrap around them with velcro straps about every 2 hours so I can walk Im traveling specifically to get into a clinical trial for my pain Theres no way they will be completely frozen when I go through  they never completely freeze anyway Im just desperate about how to ice my feet both on the plane and in the airport where I have to change plans Im flying on United Thank youWe are planning our trip to New York end of August  beginning of September ThanxWe are looking at flying from Brisbane to LA and back to Honolulu on the way home to Brisbane in late June 2014 From what I can find  Looking at that their website it appears that the in flight entertainment may be limited to either watching on the overhead screen or renting an ipad mini ThanksIm booking a longhaul flight Looking at several Internet sites flights would often be in two legs Some of these flights contain legs flown by separate airlinesWould love to hear from you if you have  airlines days of travel must see sights in Melbourne etc Any help would be appreciated Thank youWill be travelling from Australia to the USCanada in December and the best price I can get for 3 Adults is on Cathay Pacific obviously via Hong Kong Air NZ and Singapore Air too expensive and Qantas and VAustralia mean going via Sydney Having never been to Hong Kong will definitely take the opportunity to have a stopover in both directions but was From what I can tell most of these flights are now fitted with the new seats slide rather than recline I also need to keep a 12yr old occupiedMy friends  without a computer  were pleased when  them They are horrified to be The words Daylight Robbery come to my mindIve not flown since last December before the guy tried to blow up the Delta flight to Detroit and I read in the immediate aftermath about iPods not being allowed on flights So have all the restrictions been relaxed since that incident and are they what they were like before it Basically Just curious We flew with them before xmas and had a good selection of movies and was looking forward to new ones as published in their magazine and on the Web site but alas the same ones Didnt get our reserved seats and as a family of four were seperated Staff were rude and abrupt Didnt like giving out drinks and had to keep asking for water Web site was poor and wouldnt let us choose nut free meals 2 out of 10We have prebooked our seats butAnd you are paying for it It bears no resemblance to their adverts If they were a bank then their would be mismanagement companies after them Worse still got return flight at 2130 so will be starved by we get to ManchesterPositive is great cabin crew and comfortable seatsin extra leg room will fly with them again but never buy meals in advanceThe reason for not flying direct is based on price and lack of availability The outbound journey would allow us 2 hrs 5 mins to get the connecting flight in Dublin and the inbound journey would allow us 1hr 55 mins to get the connecting flight in Belfast International We will have hand luggage onlyThanks in advance Edited 855 am January 08 2015We had no

even before take off AnywayThanks so much in advance for your tips and suggestionsLooking to book a flight as a family and will be traveling with my seven and four year old children The reviews didnt reflect well upon the carrier and just want to get some feedback from anyone traveling them out of CVG Thanks in advanceThe reality here of course is that there really is nothing unbusinesslike or underhanded nor are there any bait and switch tactics in what these sites offer or what they charge as YOU authorize the total amount of charges which you agree to pay when you submit It isnt worth complaining if YOUdont exercise reasonable care  and READ THE FINE PRINT beforehand  when using such sites One thing to always be sure of is that you see a physical address for a legitmate place of business and someone whom you can contact should a problem arise Without that the website may well be a scam or dishonest Can I bring the worlds largest purse for exampleI have booked reservations on an AA flight to EuropeWe are travelling to Singapore Australia and Bali next week and have just purchased which for most airlines is fine However Any advice please ThanksBut I am wondering about the

down or robbed by independent websites has me asking this question  as I might use them in the future  any adviceI checked thir website and there was nothing obviousI have a feeling that this may have been covered before but I cannot find anything We are planning a trip to Brisbane in July and August 2015 and I am wondering whether to buy the tickets now or to wait until a few months closer to the date Current prices are round about £1300 which seems incredibly high We are fairly flexible on dates as long as they are in the school summer holidays Most of the advice I can find eg internet and talking to an agent suggests buying now Any help and advice much appreciatedI am travelling next Tuesday and I will be missing a match I had tickets for the least I want is to watch it on TV  dont care about the environment just need to watch the match ThanksMilan seems to come up as a city to fly into but we wouldnt be spending time there However would consider it if the price was rightWe just returned from a trip to Costa Rica We were traveling with 4 bags all of which had TSA locks On our return trip we cleared customs in Miami and rechecked our bags in for our flight home When we got home all but one on the TSA locks had been removed and not replaced One of the removed locks we found inside one of the bags The remaining 3 locks One case has 2 compartments to lock are gone Nothing appears to be missing except the locks but Hi I could do with a bit of guidance please iv just got back off holiday 3 day break to Lanzarote I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away personal reasons I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didnt book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them Ive had two bad experiences on my trip to and from Vegas to Portland Didnt really pay attention to the air carrier when booked  kind of figured service was close to the same through out the industry everyone is hungry right Im not sure if every flight through spirit is late but both of mine were 2hrs late leaving PDX sat their for over 5hrs and now Im sitting here writing this in the Vegas terminal where I have already been for 3hrs and will be for at least another 2 at this point Its very frustrating and extremely unprofessional in my mind I dont know how big this companys pockets are but if problems like this are persistent then Im not sure it really matters theyll dry up eventuallyHi thanks for your commentsWe have booked a thomson flight flight only Ive contacted thomson twice now and Ive had a different response both times  orwhen only

80 pages in My flight last night from JFKFRA on Lufthansa was PACKEDand I guess a lot of people had their seats screwed upso the pilot said as we were taxiing to the runway I was on an aisle of a 4 seat sectionand the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wifewho was in the row ahead of usin a middle seat I declinedas I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyeri dont show itbut I do need aisle access and i reserved my seat 2 months ago The guy was disgusted of coursethe guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a Vpositionleaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of meHe also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seatwhich i picked up and put over the side of his armrestno fussjust removed it from my lap and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat bc he needed to stand I could have went to an FAbut it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved Thoughts Alsoit was definitely a rude guy flightthe passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way backwhich is their rightI knowso i did the sameand complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bagwhich I did once or twice I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as muchbut he kept it where it was Needless to saythe flight was just peachy Lufthansa was finethoughservice was good despite the passengers We had in seat entertainmentdecent foodplenty of beverage service and free alcohol Anywayfeedback is appreciated  BuhBye CheapoAirI can plug in a multiflight in Kyak and get a price listing

it may have been American which wont help me  I realise that the days of cheap international air fares are probably over especially from Australia but Im also getting a little desperate for a holiday My travel dates are flexible but I cant find any sites that will let me ask for air fares over a date range except Air NZ that will show prices across a week Any thoughts or am a being a bit hopefulwas 45 minutes late taking off from Memphis because they were still loading baggage We arrived in Las Vegas 1 hour past Arrival time As we landed the announcement was made to lower all window shades  place seat belts in seats as the plane was scheduled to depart again quickly Waited 45 minutes  Baggage Claim No bags Passengers flooded Allegiant Office where it was determined that the baggage was not in LAS nor was it in MEM  No theres not another flight from MEM today Maybe tomorrow By the time most had spent 20 minutes filling out Lost Luggage Forms I not one to give up easily asked an Allegiant Associate if they were sure they had checked all possible cargo areas  This point Im thinking Surely they didnt put a whole flights luggage on a plane to  That would make no sense It HAS to be HERE She made a phone call Has anyone checked the middle cargo compartment Held for a few minutes Then Yaaaaaaay Duh    1 more hour before we could retrieve it from the belt So 2 hours 45 minutes of wasted gambling time Bet I could have lost  least 245 by now 😜 You would think they would at least hand out Free Drink Tickets as we were all dry  parched   way overdue for 1st cocktail No I didnt even hear Im sorry for your trouble  wait  delay  stressId really like some help with this if I could please Im looking at  Initial research seems to reveal that the EK suites are more private with sliding doors and the QF suites are more open But I would really like to make a decision that is as informed as possible as this is a large outlay so I am hoping someone might be able to provide a few firsthand pros and cons for each airlines first class offerings please By the way there will be two of us travelling and would prefer the centre sidebyside seats rather than two one behind the other on the sideHi On her passport there is only her name and not her marital statusdimensions of the bag fit TSAs guidelines Every website ive checked says I need a clear bag and Im unsure if a blue clear bag fits under that description Has anyone else tried thislike lazy boy chair style recliner ThanksA friend and I booked roundtrip tickets to Ireland on Continental for April We were notified yesterday about a schedule change for the last leg of our flightIt looks as if Continental may charge us 75 each if we do Thanks for any advice you can offer usHey all I have a flight coming up on Wednesday and did not pay close attention to my transfer flight I am flying from Des Moines IA to Atlanta GA to Los Angeles CA Unfortunately  or should I expect to have to change it somewhere along my journey ThanksWe have a few options at the moment in booking a Melbourne to London flight for DecJan this year Etihad had the best return fares but have disappeared at the moment with the next best being Malaysian followed closely by BA and Cathay Pacific For single flights we can get the same prices flying over with Singapore and returning with Etihad BA or Qantas The costs for the two oneway fares is pretty similar to the return fares Up until today I was pretty sure we would go with the one way fares mainly because Singapore has such a good name and we could then try mixed reviews Etihad on the way home or Qantas if we wanted the old faithful What changed today was that Cathay has come into the game with a very competitive return fare and I have heard that they are on a par with Singapore If this is right it would seem that taking the Cathay return fare would be the best option Thanks In September this year My new husband and I will be travelling to the riviera maya in Mexico for our honeymoon We fly from Manchester to cancun with thomsons in premium seating Ive probably worried myself needlessly However Ive been reading reviews on Thomsons long haul flights on skytrax and seatplans websites Im not sure whether one is available if there is one on the TAP airlines website it is very hard to find but Their website only seems to offer a time for a flight if you put in a day you want to travel what I want a timetable with all the flights so we can easily see which destinations have flights at reasonable times and on days we can get off work Ive got flight timetables for other airlines weve used or intend to use why dont TAP do one  Or make it more easily findable if they publish one  I have flown Qantas Jetstar Virgin Blue Pacific blue Air Nz Continental Tiger Airways Air Asia Thai Singapore Vietnam Air Bangkok Airways Freedom Air Emitates British Airways United Emirates Easyjet and probably a few more I cant remember Singapore would be my fave because of the amazing crew who will do abosolutly anything nothing is too much for them Entertainment system is top notch with large screens and plenty of movies Tv games etc there is something for everyone Another thing I love about SIA is the legroom I dont know the stats but even in economy I feel there is much more leg room than other carriers And finally the food Sia by far IMO has the best food of an airline Second for me goes to Emirates with Thai a close 3rd What are your favourite airlines I put this link up on the Orlando forum but I guess it worth doing here as well I pack and ship my stuff via FedEx or UPS all the time for vacation trips It doesnt work for business trip and shipping anything like a laptop would be rather risky more for whats on it than the laptop itself which can be insured  The contents cant usxpcomproductsandservices… There are other services available and many folks who want to have their own skis or golf clubs have been using them for sometime Just google luggage delivery service You can also check sites like TravelLiesure and TravelHoliday for more resources I like traveling luggage free but it only works for nonperishables and when youll be arriving at a responsible destination like a good hotelresort or villa rental Just a suggestion It may destress some of the travel restrictions  except the laptop oneAccording to wwwseatgurucom AA 763s come in two different first class seat configurations The 767300 ver 1 763 has regular seats The 767300 ver 2 763 has lieflat seats besides calling the airline and debating the point with a rep on the phone If I am going to pay for first class I want to be sure that Im getting a comfortable seatJust wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this Two different groups applied for their Estas An email was received to say Authorised after the initial word on application said Pending We could not book in online it came up as check in at airport We were directed to different desks around the airport the final one being the Special Assistance desk There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us We were told there was a problem with our Esta We promptly got the Esta number up on our mobile devices but the check in staff said it was too late to book 9 people in and closed the flight We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4 4 going first via Newark then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughters friend flying with our other family members We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children Tap would not help us with a hotel meals nothing We have a case open with the CAA but at this point TAP are saying we did not have the correct documents We did have them and produced them there was noone to help us at Heathrow We had no different documents on the Sunday when we were allowed to fly with UnitedTIA My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA The flight was delayed by 25 hours resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running During the flight we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt On arrival we received a quote from a London black cab for £8590 to North London This would normally be an excessive expense for us but as it was 1230am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming The final fare ended up being £97 However on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt we were informed by BAs Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered beyond reasonable and it would be unfair to other customers to make an exception via a response from the airlines Twitter accountThey also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this it would be much appreciated I have already considered raising it with the CAA  I wasnt able to prebook our seats together and now am wondering about how other things are going to go I also wasnt able to find anything on the forums unless they are part of the old XL Airways We got pretty cheap tickets and now am wondering if we are going to get what we paid for Any inputHi This was a disaster for me because on the 26th I am meeting up with my sister who lives in Sydney before she flies back on the 27th I havent seen her since 2008 I informed Silkair of the problem and they asked if I wanted a refund I immediately said yes and then rebooked with Air Asia to land in Singapore on the 27th But then said they could reroute me via KL on the 27th so I told them I had already booked the other tickets and asked for a refund They then It was their decision to change the dates of the flightsI have just booked my vacation with Liberty Travel for a trip to Cancun Frontier had the best prices for a nonstop flight Now I am reading a ton of bad reviews Im nervous I booked a round trip ticket w 5 days in between departures for 36000 USD on virgin air I heard wonderful things Its modern Everyone is so friendly Free wifi great in flight entertainment  Electrical outlets at every seat I was sold I thought I got a great deal  never flown to nyc before and 36000 seems like a steal But now im a little nervous Maybe Ive been reading too many reviews by difficult passangers but I have heard  There is only free wifi on flights from sfo to jfk all others must bay 1300 usd most outlets dont work  was a common complaint Ive heard no free inflight drinks or snacks  not even water inflight movies and ther entertainment are available for an undisclosed fee Now im not by any means a difficult passanger I pay attention during the safety lecture bring my own food and drinks as well as a book or two and most of all I realize the flight attendants are there for safety and not to be a sky waitress But after reading hearing all that I cant help but feel like I got a bad deal I adore jetblue and I feel like I should have booked with them I could have had a free cold drink mid flight and some basic cable incase I tire of reading  I worry that she may not want to board with out me or she may have a hard time navigating the rows alone Im really just looking for some real experiences from agreeable passengers who have flown VA and to see if I got the great deal I thought I did Thanks for your help  and honestyEasyJet have announced they will close their base in Madrid this October pulling all eight aircraft out and redeploying them elsewhere across Europe Although only 20 of services will be lost within the next year EasyJet are still selling tickets as normal through the winter season with no route or frequency cuts at all other than Manchester and schedules still show early morning departures and late night arrivals in Madrid which shows that aircraft is based there Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they wont happen but others less so will not Id say for the time being people DO NOT BOOK EASYJET FLIGHTS TOFROM MADRID POST OCTOBER 2012 AS THERES A CHANCE IT MAY NOT FLY Give it a couple of weeks or so unless anything happens before hand Anybody remember when they closed East Midlands flights They sold them and people were booking them when EasyJet knew they wouldnt fly at that time Same seems to be happening here Edited 417 am June 23 2012The flight time changed but Orbitz didnt notify us I just happened to check the Alitalia website the day before That wasnt a big drama but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service The real problem started at the airport we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a I was at the airport trying to check in b No i didnt want to cancel my booking and c I am Australian so my zip code has only 4 digits we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around 250 before checkin close Since the flight I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email who just say to call When I call Im repeatedly put on hold paying international call rates and was told on the last call that Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline reaccommodated us on a later flight They do not read my emails or listen to what I have to say ie we only got on the later flight after we purchased new tickets just keep repeating the line that the airline put on a later flight Im sure we have some rights under the Montreal Convention but its hard to make any claims when you get no response from the airline or incoherent useless responses from the agentI have an upcoming trip that is on a US Airways ticket but one of the flight segments is on UA metal I change from US to UA at SFO the airlines are in different terminals I am familiar with this airport but have never had to travel between terminals before I couldnt find this specific info anywhere online My connection time is about an hour and 20 minutes so I am not too worried but just would like to know what to expect ahead of timeSome of you may remember my post from last year tripadvisorcoukShowTopicg1i10702k64972… The thread appears to have been frozen however I resurrect it now to give you an update  Until last week I hadnt flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing  Once again the staff were polite and professional  but this time I was prepared My regular explosive solution was in my checked luggage and in my hand luggage said shouldnt test positive  and they were right It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me  apart from once in Bilbao when they suspected it was something totally different  but thats another story   in their hand luggage  they seem to be on the lookout for it I was assured I was simply chosen at random though Im sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the Xray machine  For clarification the solution that tested positive was Specsavers Easyvision Allpurpose solution the safe solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose If anyone needs a 100ml bottle they have a stock in Specsavers in Queen Street Cardiff Im due to fly out of gatwick to las vegas in just over three weeks ie if they have premium economy seats left they might aswell use up my points and let me upgrade any help or experience of similar scenarios would be appreciated cheersHello Thanksthey charged me 67200 because i had to change my flight from one day to another when i complained they gave me back a whopping 15000 steer clear of this company pleaseCan leave anytime This was my first flight so I did a lot of research  Our flight was on time we arrived early and had no problems LBE is a small airport and very easy to navigateWe were delayed 22hours last week and were late arriving at Male We are both airline crew so were wise to the excuses they gave They basically blamed snow Spanish ATC and fog at Gatwick all of which were lies The airline were most unhelpful and had no reps at any point during the delay and lied to us about the reason for the heavy delay Thomson couldnt even send a rep the next day to the Gatwick Hilton hotel with details of our departure time and on our return we should have been given a letter stating a technical problem for the delay not all the lies originally given Despite asking for an address to write to for compensation via the rep in the Maldives she failed to give us a letter on why the delay happened which we were entitled to and had to get a copy of this via a kind passenger Because of the dishonesty and the fact they were spineless to confront their passengers we wont be using them again This was by far the worst service I have received from any company and ruined a truly amazing holiday Im trying to fly from moline il to daytona beach This is outrageous an my vacation isnt till may an they have jumped 500 I can fly to Mexico for cheaper than that whats the deal hereIts years since we have flown can anyone adviseUsing first choice just need peace of mindI had not been singled out for one of those random security checks where they go through everything in your carry on and person for a very very long time Until last month that is I believe the last time I was selected was several years ago Last month my flt was cancelled and my airline UAL switched me to a Delta flt I had to retreive my bag change terminalscheck in with Delta and go through security a 2nd time We ordered train tickets over the phone for a specified time 1245pm and got on the trian only to find out that we were given the wrong boarding passes 245pm We noticed this after a request to show our tickets halfway enroute to London The conductor on that train was so rude and didnt listen to any of our complaints and ended up slapping us in the face with a fine of 101 British pounds 190 each with my travel compainion Our efforts to discuss the matter with Virgin trains were turned away On the same car another lady had the same problem but was welcomed with police at the train station in Euston because she failed to pay the fine Please write me back on allen63netzerocom Back in the US I run out of luck with limited help from the Headquaters of Virgin Atlantic in CT Thanks in advanceMost airlines seem to mention that you can have a carryon and a personal item but its not mentioned here My husband usually brings his scuba regulator as his personal item and weve never had an issue with other airlines The checked baggage allowance is more than we need but we dont like checking our regulators in case they get they get jostled too much and dont work I checked mine once and had problems with it on the first dive so havent checked it again since I will be arriving from London at 9am and then connecting to LAX at 1030am Air France OKd it saying 55 minutes is the minimum connection time but really so you think 15 hours is sufficient ThanksDH and I are in Israel for 23 years and our goal is to see as much of the world as possible in our lifetimesplease Ideally these are 4 hour or less flights since many of these trips will be long weekendsIts hard to find detailed information on hotel websites and I can see from some tripadvisor reviews that some hotels only have hourly shuttle services in which case its probably worth getting a taxi for early morning flights and Ill price that in when making my choice Last time I had a 1 night stopover the hotel only operated a small minivan to get to JFK in the early morning despite using a bigger vehicle the night before and we had to wait over 10 minutes for the driver to try to squeeze all the passengers and luggage on with some luggagepassengers ending up on other peoples laps and some left behindWere looking to book a packaged vacation for May 1st out of Vancouver  eckHi So not the main photo page but the observation page opposite Apart from that the passport is perfectMy bag with the things I need to stay busy I need access to They wont put it up top

of the previous reviews are not so good feedback would be appreciatedLike many other passengers I got fooled I booked a Madrid to Casablanca flight departing at 1300 When I got to Madrid airport I was told the flight was at 1850 I Had to wait for more than 6 hours at the airport But not only this I cant seem to find any information on Sunwing and how large the seats are Are they simular to Skyservice Skysquish or more like Air Transat and WestJet or more generous like Air Canada I am just trying to get a sense whether members of my party may require the seatbelt extenders or if we are better off booking with another airline Past experience has been that the seatbelt extenders were only required on SkyService but no issues with economy class in the other airlines Thank youThe Harrisburg to Newark flight has been canceled for the last two day and there are no other flights that would get me to Newark in time for our international flight I am worried that if I cancel my flight myself they might also cancel my international seat I do have trip insurance through Expedia Thank you for your advice I am an infrequent flierhi Not ERas per my ticketwhich looks more like a

luggage howeverI have this horrible vision of arriving in Sydney and waiting at the luggage caroousel whilst my luggage is sitting very lonely on a carousel in Gatwick EeeekQuestion to all the experts out there I do have a flexible ticket backup with Virgin but want to cancel that tomorrow if its safe to ThanksAirlines are being ordered to pay compensation for long flight delays and claims can go back 6 years  I had a nightmare delay in June 2011 but cannot claim as i have very few details of the flight  The flight was a Thomson late night flight from Malaga to London Gatwick I think  in mid June 2011 When we got to the airport we were told the flight was subject to a long delay so we were taken to a hotel in Torremolinos for an overnight stay  The flight was delayed until the next afternoon  Does this ring a bell with anyone  Any help would be much appreciated ThanksAre travellers aware that in booking a package with Expedia that in the case of Air France luggage charges will be added to the fare at the check in desk and you will be asked for immediate payment before being allowed to board We recently returned from a trip to Florence having booked a hotel and flights deal On arriving at the desk we were charged in excess of an extra £100 baggage charges Of course Expedia will no doubt point out that they do say in quite small print that the airline may make extra charges Such a pity that these nasty little surprises await us to add to the already stressful event that air travel has become driven by the grubby and petty greed of formerly honourable companies Read everything no matter how small the print  NEVER trust a travel firm tourist has for some time meant sucker PMHi I have booked a flight to JFK from Manchester with Lufthansa The flight will go from Manchester to Frankfurt and then connect on to another flight to JFKThanksHaving trawled various sites we may be looking for something which is not available but if anyone can provide info it would be appreciated This is fine for all the main bits of cover but only covers missed intl flights from and to UKor is it simply just make sure you dont miss a flight andor hope the airline is accommodating if fates conspire against you Happy New Year and thanks MikeShe wasnt sure why there was a delayhe flight is from new orleans to venice marco polo with plenty of time between stops in frankfurt and vienna No fees like Expedia which charges 999 Many of these airlines give too tight times between the layovers you need at least 2 hours for the passport control and to catch your flight Hi Hi I know all about charges for baggage changes in policy fees next year so that does not need to be addressed on this questionThanks Edited 525 am November 30 2014 Ive looked in March and May and it doesnt show up on the United website or Expediaim getting a bit worried about the flight after reading some of the postings with there being 5 of us upgrading to premier class isnt really an option it adds up to quite a lot of money Hi Boise to Bangkok cost 921 per person round trip all flights on time no baggage lost I got upgraded to economy plus on 3 out of 4 international flight legs for no charge meals were OK service staff were pleasant watched 8 movies i hadnt seen before for me a typical boreing uneventful experience LOL but that is what I expect when I fly I researched and made sure I flew on 777s not the old 747 the 777s have seat back screens Our travel agent and the airlines state this is a legal connection and there is no other connecting flight later that night I am concerned that this is a legal connection for a 25 year old that can run but I am nudging 70 and my fastest pace is slow Am I being needlessly concerned Any advice is appreciated  thank youHI  when you enter USA  you go thru immigration to see if they will allow you entry then you go thru customs where they look for contrabane You do not go thru TSA You only encounter TSA if you have an ownward domestic flight when you leave USA or have a domestic flight then you go thru TSA security  LOLBy the way I have checked the deodorant bottle and it does say its flammable Im thinking of personal

this on the Air Travel forum 1 We left over 2 hours late both going to and departing Hawaii No staff members were informing the travellers about any delays 2 Food was extremely poor especially for the cost of 25 per person per flight Going to Hawaii we only had one choice for each meal Dinner  Small size Chicken and Rice Salad and a small chocolate  Breakfast A meat pie Yes that is right for breakfast and a ice cream bar Not my idea of a breakfast meal at 3am 3 The flight crew were nearly invisible mostly talking to each other for the flight as our rubbish stayed infront of us for atleast 115 hours 4 In flight entertainment  was not handed out until at least 2 hour into the flightHello after i oredered the tickets i saw all the bad reviews here  Too late   y now in the begining we both

more expensive Ive heard great things about Singapore and know nothing about Qatar air Please helpHey I posted a while ago about flights going to orlando in September with aerlingus from Dublin there was a bug with website but its fixed now  The flight dates I want have just came out today 3rd to 17th sep on the site but I dont know if its best to book immediately or wait working about €800 return I have been watching the prices around those dates and I think the prices have suddenly went up about €80 from the other day Not sure if I should book now to avoid further hikes or wait Thanks for any advice Hi   our plans are flying into jfk staying in New York 3 nights  Then we fly to San Franscisco for 3 nights then back to jfk where we fly to Jamaica for a week then back to jfk where we fly

used them before  got to LAX for a flight to Las Vegas only to find out it had been cancelled Even though mobile phone number was provided when booking made I received no phone call or SMS We were not even trandferred or wait listed on the following flight even though I hold a gold card emerald for a partner airline Told us we were booked on a flight 6 hours later which would have meant we would have missed our prebooked trips in Vegas After inquiring about car hire  how long it would take to drive  we were informed that wed get there before the one were not wait listed on would have even taken off  After a bit more complaining the manager came out  offered t omove us across to United Airlins I bet that hurt  Return flight to Hawaii was not much better either but well save that for another time Spoke to Rolf Saxon at Las Vegas airport who wasflying on our flight to San Fran on Virgin America  even he said he would NOT fly with AA  being an actor he is flying around alll the time It also meant calling both airlines when I wanted to make a change to my itinerary and is just an all round pain However I didnt realize that I could check both airlines for this flight until after I had booked It may be that I could have got my flight cheaper on one if they had not sold out their allocation of lowest fare seatsThank youOur son lives in Atlanta and from time to time we get our grandchildren to come visit us in Florida They have been flying in and out of Orlando on Air Tran Now this is NOT a rant post against Air Tran but I am going to start flying them on Delta out of Melbourne Reason being that the last two times we went to Orlando the service was so slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow that they missed the booked flight Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time The problem seems to be two fold First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the back to assist you Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time That is NOT the case in Melbourne as they are expediant and professional at all times Book a plane ticket to find out 4 days later that no ticket was

planning my honeymoon and haveWe are spending 2 weeks in china and 1 week in thailandThis seems to be the cheapest way to get to phuket from china by flying guilin to kl to phuket with air asiaIt kind

ThanksThey say there arebut as we booked through TC I have to sort with them I have yet to get anyone at TC who can do this as they have booked 30 seats on the flight as a group Wondered if anyone else has succeeded in upgrading in the past Thanks Im an AAdvantage Platinum who was really concerned about flying 15 hours to Europe and then 5 more hours to Asia with my elderly mother The experience was nothing compared to the usual service you would receive on board a US airline Air France provided an excellent service onboard and were completely oriented towards creating a smooth experience for my mother at the airport We had to do this route before with Iberia and their on board service was terrible I can only wish Air France flew from South America to the US as well By the way I am not French I dont speak the language and we were flying Economy and if you stick to the rules your ok But and this one is for you bigstei had to laugh at this wwwyoutubecomwatch…British

might not start on time Also havent met anyone who has traveled on this airline before It will be our familys first experience flying overseas and I would like to be comfortableyes short flight long story tickets bought using milesHello Thanksto be on the safe sideThey are in the 70  75 age range Last flew there 10 years ago on Royal Brunei and suffered leg swelling  discomfortThanks in advanceWhen I asked for my original seat they told me to take the seat I was given or they would have me removed from the plane that I shouldnt worry asThanks a lot United I didnt want my money back I wanted to fly comfortably United is interested in filling and moving planes not in serving customers In my opinion Uniteds skies definitely are not friendly The folks at the desk lied to me told me that seat 29B was economy plus and were rude The flight attendant at the back was insolent And one of the United staff actually threatened me There MUST be a better way to travelI guess but Ill give it another whack I am not an experienced air traveller but I booked the cheapest fare economy tango for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices I have to say 25 is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights I am disappointed at losing 2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out except for the nasty cancellation fee My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare I wouldnt mind so much if the price drop wasnt so large If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticketNow I know the meaning of the bromide you get what you pay for allowing 4 hours me when I expressed concern that I would miss my connection for an additional GBP 200 about 40000 and 20 times what I paid for the original Ryanair ticket After several attempts to contact them I dont expect them to address this issue Never Againcheap but not having used them beforeI am trying to decide which flight to take and I have a question about layover time on a connection through Heathrow Here are the flight detailsMost of my London flights are to Gatwick so Im not as familar with HeathrowAny help is greatly appreciatedBe very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency However looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website In short we have booked vacations through many online companies that are ethical THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support a common thread in many reviews for your company I shop online a lot and book trips through online travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at checkout I am from Canada and shop in the US UK and of course Canada We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds funds were at par and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise For example even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD We were pretty shocked when we were billed 450 more than we were invoiced for on our credit card When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human we are a US company we charge in USD I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD you dont tell your customers you charge USD A call to the supervisor was a waste of time He could care less The LAST think a customer wants to here is we are not doing anything for you So as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices shady and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction Also you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps When asked How are youthe response of I am okayis not professional at all In addition perhaps educate your staff that a com company does not indicate you are US based I work for a Canadian based company with a com site Then again we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoicesThe items missing included I didnt have a comprehensive list of the contents  a cordless drill the whole thing including the case was taken not just the battery  a bicycle light again the whole set was removed not just the battery  a cartridge of silicone sealant  a cartridge of adhesive  a bottle of medicines The airline has refused to take responsibility saying the items were removed by security personnelThanks not because we dont want to pay for luggage but because on our last trip through Heathrow British Air lost our checked bags in BOTH directionsI did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem Also it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May when the LAX porter said that bag is too big for a carry on butIf we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack Hi we are leaving in a weekin order to facilitate dialogue with the company regarding the sale by AENA Here in Tenerife strikes were planned for 27th and 30th but hopefully these too will not go ahead if discussions are favourable Source eldiaestenerife201408146trabajadores…Okay so weve got the least favourite airline and why thread so I thought Id start a favourite airline and why one Even in economy On one occasion I was travelling with my wedding dress and I emailed ahead just to ask how they would advise I carry it They suggested as hand luggage but they also very kindly arranged to have a cake and cocktails delivered to us on board That was really lovely of them  for that hop HRWAKLHi Ive contacted thomson twice now and Ive had a different response both

refused to send me a confirmation of their mistake and receipt for what I SHOULD have been charged 5 more phone calls later and being what I consider now to be purposely cut off  I am still waiting to speak to a Manager I have tried emailing with no response either  and dont expect any kind of customer service thanks for any replys dawnHi Many thanks in advanceHi alla UK based travel agency They deal in multistop itineraries on which special rules seem to apply When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names HoweverI usually write my name as Luuk while my passport says Lucas I remember signing emails with Luuk yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport At that point it wasnt to big a deal but I got to fly anyway I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it Im currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong I could make all flights with the wrong name even if that sometimes led to skewed faces since I provided them with the correct names In the accompanying email in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc they stated that this is not a guarantee for the USA So now Im getting a bit freaked Im sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations but If I cant fly to the US that would be awfull Just wanted to express my annoyancebecause apparently we have to drop off passengers in Jamaica uhg We lose about 12 a day of vacy because of this totally annoyedHiI am totally confused with the regulations at this stage Thanks in advance JoeWe are flying Melbourne to Paris on China Eastern in June this year 2013 with a 5 hour stopover in Shanghai Trying to find out if theres a transit lounge where we can shower and changeto help with having a quiet flight have a window and see the alps if it was clearour names were called out and I pointed out we had pre booked as could have the family if they had desired to sit with each other To no avail of course as they had made their decision I think this was rather poor of them as I thought they would have the points I have with them to give me a flight one wayHithe prices at the moment are quite high compared to if I wanted to travel at the same time this year Many thanks AnnAirAsia has every possible fee or charge imaginable Flying from SIN to DPS or HKT the published fare was around 155 USD but the final price I paid was 350 USD I believe this is extremely poor and misleading practice which eventually deter many customers Look into KLM for a cheaper and more professional approach to air travel to avoid AirAsias hagglingJust want to ask a question hope someone can clarifyI keep getting different answers Planning to go to Portugal in August to renew Thx in advance Best of all there is no hassel My flight was from Pheonix to JFK in November 2010 and it went like a breezeHello as far as I knowI figure it should be in the luggage you carry inside the plane but Edited 808 am April 27 2016I recently took a job that will have me traveling in and out of Russia once a month I just got the itinerary for my first trip and the longer flights are with Lufthansa the shorter trips are with United I currently have a United FF with a few miles but nothing significant It looks like the majority of my flights will be fare class T but only one of the flights is within Europe I can give all the details on the flights but I dont want to unnecessarily bore everyone with the details ThanksWere thinking of using it again We have connecting flightsAnyone know a way to do thisI was thinking of

cruise it selfPeople have been using Stansted for years Essex is a big county and Luton and Gatwick are a long way Because of this I will no longer be able to travel with TUI If flights resume I will be back like a shot Otherwise farewell Ayia Napa and the crew was so friendly and very helpful The economy meal was pretty darn good too with the gelato for dessert a surprise We arrived on time 6 am at terminal 2 which was a first for us who are used to the prior terminal 1 I think or terminal 2 has had a massive facelift Our bags arrived unscathed from our departure at SMF Hi all I cant find any hard case thats smaller I am definitely wanting a hard caseIf not I hope they make this available soonThis seems to be common practice by Aeromexico whatever the whatever the season as I and others have experienced this on numerous occasions with this airline a friend booked on the next flight had the same experience convincing me to avoid Aeromexico at all costs After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor and explaining our situation she said she would investigate further and disappeared only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us She promised to place us first on a wait list for the flight we had booked When we appeared at the departure gate we noticed our names were numbers 18 and 22 on the electronic display of wait listed passengers Aeromexico and its staff do not understand customer service Avoid this airline at all costs particularly if your arrival time is of the essence either for a connecting flight or an important appointment happy that Aurela are not supplying Monarch anaymore but they have also used a Slovakian airline which also ran into to trouble a couple of months ago with a Mayday call heard by passengers had to emergency land in France as I am very worried now especially being a nervous passenger and am due to fly with them to Portugal early OctoberWould 2 hours be enough or should we add

this as we are nervous about people moving our carThe bottom line on Delta CoachDeltas other planes are configured with so little seat room leg room etc ie pitch that they are like CROWDED CATTLE CARS The airline should be ashamed to even put people on those planes but clearly Delta does not care one iota about its passengers comfort even for long flights I made the mistake on a recent HNL to LAX flight of flying Delta coach on a 757 never again So check before you book and if its a newer 767 the plane should be ok better pitch personal entertainment unit etc You can ckeck pitch and seat specs

it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned Everything in the bag was a mess this time round but Im not sure if this was because of the way it was handled Some

Thanks alland if so whichor will we be regretting our decisionI travelled to Australia using STA travel  Never again I was taken ill and admitted to hospital and had to change my flights STA travel informed my husband and I that we had to rebook our tickets immediately that they would be held for 10 days each ticket at a cost of £150 each that after the 10 days if they had not been used then we would have to rebook for another 10 days at another £150 each and so on Clearly I had no idea when I could travel back to the UK Clearly this advice was absolute rubbish The Airline and our travel insurance sorted it all out no problem The 10 day rule by STA and the £150 each ticket is clearly a money making exercise I have been offered a paltry compensation which I have not accepted Customer services does not appear to be contactable by phone they do not reply to letters Now what do I doLooked on their website and they only mention excess baggage which is what Im trying to avoiduntil after the date we are due to travel a week todaythe passport office are being very inflexible and it looks like we are not going on holiday nowThe DublinBoston and return BosstonDublin segments are

Rome to check in and check my bag the lady gave me 3 boarding passes for all my flights and one luggage receipt with each connection listed on it including my final destinationalthough the property was nice We signed up for trip alerts and didnt receive any but one that said they were ontime Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got 5 which doesnt buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort Coming home was no better Web check in wasnt even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time even though they were not They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back On the 75 hour flight down we had one drink

guysthanks a lotTIAMy wife and I flew Delta from JFK to Rome Italy early June 2010 It was a nightmare The plane had mechanical problems forcing us to divert to Halifax Nova Scotia for nearly 10 hours  The flight crew was impolite and unhelpful not to mention misleading in keeping passengers up to date on when wed be back on schedule to our destination Since we came home and shared this experience with friends and family weve heard that our story is nothing new Delta has a well established reputation for messing up travel plans of passengers So my advice to you is avoid Delta Air Lines

travelling MunichViennaParis My first plan was take the train for MunichVienna then fly ViennaParis Except that if I buy flight tickets for MUCVIECDG on a single itinerary its cheaper than if I buy single VIECDG ticket by more than half Im a KrisFlyer member so I was looking at LHOS flightsAfter 40 minutes googling and browsing the BA website even trying to actually buy the tickets I havent yet understood how much will I pay to change the date of my return The only helping thing Ive found is this paragraph but following their logic I should buy the ticket first to see what type is it What type of ticket do you have If youre unsure of the type of ticket you have you can log into Manage My Booking to find out By selecting your flight and then clicking on the Change  Cancel booking option you can see whether or not changes can be made free of charge with a charge or not at all Could you help me Edited 1235 pm April 08 2015I havent yet booked this flight as I know all the issues about

online checkin without any problems They emailed us reminders of both online check in and luggage sizes more than once prior to our departure flight The flights were on time and we were very pleased with how everything had gone We will most certainly use them again as we were very impressed Huge thanks to them for ensuring our 30th wedding anniversary trip went well flights wise I appreciate that

and get on another planethe last thing I want is to have no clothes on my holiday  not basinettstheres been some staffing issues with Immigration officers or lack thereof  before youre processed and able to claim your bagDoes anyone know the truth of this ThanksI always use Kayak etc to search for flights then buy direct from the airline This time its not working out that way Im trying to get from upstate NY Ithaca Syracuse to Managua Nicagragua Im getting a great deal 250 less than airlines through Orbitz and Priceline The deal is with Copa AirlinesAlthough the US flights are codeshare with United Copa wont even let me choose an upstate NY airport so no luck booking direct from them Unitedcom for the same flights is much more expensive Although I can get flights on American its the cost thats luring me to the Orbitz price As long as I dont have to make any changes to my itinerary once its booked I cant see why I shouldnt go for itbut going 3rd party always make me a tad nervousThoughtsadviceHi everyonedestination city does not matter Coming home from Buffalo I can do BUFPHLHarrisburg for very cheap and hop off in PHL But getting to Buffalo especially nonstop is expensive SoIve done some research but no luck yet so any help would be greatly appreciated Recently we flew to the Maldives with Etihadby which I think they meant that economy was overbooked The checkin staff had overridden our prebooked seats and gave us different seats Their reason was the overbooking but I couldnt understand what that had to do with it So basically its done like Ive booked flights for two people with the exact same namemine ThanksI noted with interest the discussion a few days ago about not sitting unmins next to males The older child16 refused to fly and stayed with the 13 year oldthey were then given some vouchersabout 500 dollars for 2and told to take the shuttle to the hilton It took the pair a few minutes to find the shuttlethen on arrival the hilton refused to accomodate thembecause they were both under 18 FortunatelyHilton called USAIR and demanded they send a repchaparone to collect the childrenand took care of the pair USAIR finally booked them into the airport Marriottwith the chaparone in the next room The children travelled the next dayunharmedso alls well that ends wellNot sure if they sat next to a single male or notThe DOT complaint should

good serviceany comments pleasefor Manila to Hong Kong and later that day had a connecting with British Airways to London I received a conformation email bill invoice and checked my bank statement to see that the money had been taken out Upon arrival for my flight i was told that i didnt have a reservation due to a card being declined I was rushing around Manila airport to try and solve this ended up getting an hour bus in Manila traffic to another terminal to speak to customer service and they couldnt help me I had a connecting flight later so i had to fly that day I was forced to book another flight which left in two hours and cost alot more than the original thank god they had another flight with space on it otherwise i would have missed my connecting flight too I arrived back on the 11th and have since been trying to contact them on their website they have a UK number which apparently is open 24 hrs The number is not recognised i called the Bravo Fly car service to try and get transferred I spoke to a very grumpy man telling me its a completely different company and he is getting ridiculous amounts of calls everyday regarding the same thing I have been basically been robbed and this could have turned out alot worse than it did had i missed my connecting flight Please please let me Hi everyone  so it a lot of money Any comments will be greatly receivedI have upcoming flights with UA which includes a layover in IAD and have access to the UA Club Lounges at Gates C7 C17 or D8  or should I just use the one closest to my departure gate Thanks in advance for any informationWe are arriving from our holidays back at T5 LHR with a few extra check in bags We have parked the car at the long stay park As we have one too many bags to fit in our car we are thinking may be one of us should take the National express bus from the airport to home But I remember reading in this forum that there are Helloand we are travelling on the a380 of the upstairs behind business class CarolI am a bit confused This is stated in the rules but not made clear during purchase They state that an Economy Plus purchase is not refundable but do not make clear that you may not change the itinerary without losing your economy plus seatOn way back we fly with BA on world traveller flight on a 777 I had purchased tickets for my wife daughter and myself online with no problems Upon arrival at Zacatecas ZCL for our flight to Chicago Midway MDW they said the system wouldnt let them check her in because shes two years old despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican and US passports They couldnt get el sistema to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two she was 1 year 11 months They gave us the ultimatum buy a full price ticket or dont fly Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner we caved But as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult el sistema wouldnt let them because she was not yet two years old They eventually lied entered an older age and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund Essentially the same thing happened on the return flight except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one Naturally customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish In Spanish theyll talk down to you tell you it was your fault and stonewall you Theyll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor In English theyll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing saying theyll call you back after checking with the airport for more details Surprise surprise they never call back If you then call them back the supervisor if youre lucky enough to get one usually the reps just refuse to connect you will not take your call leaving you on hold for hours If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor hell tell his reps to tell you hell call you right back Two months later and many many hours on the phone still no refund Next stop PROFECO  besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the sameA group of us are flying Manchester to Dalaman

its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights Here is the email Dear Mrsnip Thank you for your direct candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buyonboard options in United Economy on certain transAtlantic flights We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights The response from you and many of our corporate customers even before we launched the test told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded  you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights In this environment where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares As such we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas On October 1 we will proceed with the test of new complimentary options for United Business customers on threecabin aircraft used for domestic routes which represents 16 daily flights Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches salads breakfast snack boxes or snacks depending on the length of flight and time of departure They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages including beer wine and cocktails We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year Its also important to note that full meals will still be served on our ps transcontinental flights Thank you again for your feedback We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value Sincerely Graham Atkinson Chief Customer OfficerThese closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R which are the primary runways for arriving flights Only one runway will be closed at any given time During closures the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour Delays for flights originating within a twohour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times Peak times are between 900 am to1200 pm and 600 pm to 900 pm Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays flysfocomweb…updates The dates listed are  Jan 1114 Jan 1821 Jan 2528 April 58 April 1215 April 1922 April 2629  June 2526 and and June 2728  Runways 28L and 28R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time will be subject to delays These airports cover most of the west coast from San Diego SAN in the south to Portland PDX  my home in the north Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO so may not be immune These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same days it could be big time problems If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates as referenced above youd be advised to contact your airline If youre planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates allow an enormous amount of contingency and even consider avoiding SFO altogetherHi Im wondering if it is possible to change the return round trip flights to another departure location I originally bought the round trip tickets TorontoChina and ChinaToronto In between Im also planning on going to other nearby countriesHongkong Taiwan Japan I havent bought other tickets yet including the last flight from JapanChina the one Im trying to avoid buying right now The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto But right now something came up and I will have to return early Basically Im asking if theres a way to change my return roundtrip flight from chinatoronto to japantoronto so I wont have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight  Please let me know what would be the best option for me Thankss Mtrip to africa had a great time but ran into some difficulties south african airways maind office told me i had to buy all new to i was on phone for many hours my phlights were already sold out so i ended up buying all new tickets i was metting my sister in johanesberg aweek after i left jfk and she was going to bring my tickets that my wife sent from hawaii fed X TO L Aso ionly needed e ticket for first week of trip When i got to jfk the manager for south african airlines was great gave me e tickets why couldent main office do thatCheap tickets told me they dont give out hard copies but that is what they sent me  when i got home i tried to get refund Cheap tickets should have refunded me when i called them back they gave me the attitude like it is not our broblem then i went with credit card they said no problems then i week later said i had to deal with south african aifways i dealt with them for 3 months never geting a call back manager never in office left numuerous msgs finally i only got half of my money back i stll lost out on 230000 I work for a major hotel been in the bussiness for 30 years would never treat guest like that my sister who used cheap tickets too and me will never use them again and south african airways needs to change there policeseverybody at south african except for main office were greatThis is not an airline I thought I would ever use However I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this thankfully we were fine I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay However I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights In fact as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly Again I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough Another slightly annoying things was that my mum who travels on a Barbados passport had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey Would I fly Ryanair again Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rulesJust thought I would let you travelers know about it Very disappointed Followed their instructions to the letter and had 2 failed calls before getting hold of someone who said they would call us when he knew when he would be there Booked them for 0430 and they had not turned up or answered their phone by 0450 and check in was closing at 0510 Gatwick Valet parking came to the rescue and got the car parked and to check in with 4 minutes to spare Sticking to Gatwick Valet parking from now on At least the car was kept under cover and on siteExcuse the naivete of this question longas in so I have the entire day in ZurichPlan to take the train to city centre do some touring etcDont know why it bothering me to check it through to final destination just never have actually let my luggage sit that long in transit I suppose I could check it to Zurich claim it and check in again at nightam not flying economy so checking in again would not take too long and Zurich has a left luggage office so I can store it and my carry on bag thereI just received from them I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately Two working days later when I checked my itinerary it was flagged as pending unpaid As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department When I eventually got through after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my banks confirmation of payment which I duly did Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that However this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary which I had Not only that but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call which I thought was pretty good follow up I would have thought theyd give up after the second try They did leave voice mail but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally so they also didnt take that out and call it goodI am Vietnamese On 25 July 2016 my application visa was denied by the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City and one denial stamp was put on the last page of my passport The reason why I applied for the visa because I planned to visit Jeju Island in 2 days and then to spend 6 next days in Seoul However because my application was denied I intend to change my plan that I will visit Jeju Island only without going to Korea mainland I will have a direct flight from Shanghai to Jeju Island without transiting at any airport on the Korea mainlandWith the denial stamp on the passport am I still allowed to enter Jeju As I know Jeju Island has the free entry visa policy However I am concerning that due to the denial stamp I am not entitled to enjoy such policy Since my trip will start on 10 September 2016 your quick response would be appreciated Thanks in advance PS Is there anyone having experience on this one beforeQuestiona few months ago A couple of days agoIt is hardly the end of the world and can manage with the change but I feel like I am getting less than I paid for as Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO 10 pax with reserved seating in economy All pretty routine Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons and sons girlfriend So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later Heck yes especially with a PE upgrade thrown in 747400 Barbarella great IFE pretty good food chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment excellent attentive service Seat are good pitch but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids hey ho MCO arrival was excellent We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage Immigration was empty used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on I know some have reported this process being done twice over with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan Grabbed bags hit the tram and out So great experience all round even saw the Dreamliner at MAN  Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats or in my case less Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and twoyear old Of course with kids especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path I knew wed be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and prepaid seat assignments Flights were delayed lines were long ground staff was overworked and with exception of one nice man rude  but figured you get what you pay for Little did I know you can actually get less than you paid for  on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach  causing in addition to very long lines always fun with a 2year old the loss of all information on who prepaid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating Annoying but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone prepaying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1800 number Other than asking twice for the 1800 number and never getting it we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia However upon returning and calling the 1800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats  I would not have any money refunded So you can get less that what you paid for  even on a budget airlineFor those of you who are not familiar with Westjet it is a Canadian discount carrier that we have flown for years It has been very solid and reliable for us and is our domestic airline of choice However Westjet seems to be encountering some problems seemingly from its conversion to a new reservation system I have been trying for 24 hours The wait to speak to a customer service rep is currently 45  60 minutes and they warn you that they can only accept credit card payment at this time I have looked online but it is the same situation In the meantime the current seat sale deadline is fast approaching Are there any Westjetters or anyone else out there who can provide some clarification as to what is going on and how long before it is sorted out ie I can use my travel credits Thanks so muchSo I booked a flight with Aeromexico from London to Mexico City yesterday evening at a pretty awesome price compared to BAAir FranceKLM HOWEVER since I made the booking I have already had 3 pretty stressful phonecalls with a travel agency called Bravo Travel who seem to be processing the booking The English Aeromexico website doesnt seem completely finished yet and didnt ask for any of my personal details such as date of birth nationality passport etc so these have to be given over the phone This is where the problems started as the person from Bravo Travel doesnt speak English and cannot understand me And I on the other hand am extremely confused and frustrated that I cant speak to Aeromexico directly or email them for that matter  or has someone else on here already tried them and can help me I cant seem to talk to anyone who can write down my passport details correctly I am already stressed out because now I think therell be something wrong with the ticket  Any input would be much appreciatedI like to fill out the application for travel insurance correctly so that if I should need it in case of emergency the insurance company cant claim that my application was invalid because I did it wrong The problem is that Ive asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and Ive gotten 3 different answers I dont think the telephone reps understand this either My question is this Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket the taxes and fees which I paid were about 1100 OUCH  The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket I knew this wasnt correct so I called back The second agent told me I could only list the cost to redeposit the points in case of cancellation This would be 65 USD I wanted to doublecheck so I called back a 3rd time and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees In case of cancellation I would get the taxes and fees back from BA YIKESI dont know what to do now  How do I avoid future trouble about this Thanksor does Silk work as an independent budget pointtopoint airline I am looking at a flight schedule that has 2 hours between arriving into Singapore Changi SIN at 0555 T3 on a Singapore Airlines flight departing on a Silk Air flight at 0755 T2 If I can check baggage right through at the start of my journey and simply transit airside from T3 to T2 I think this will work If I have to get my baggage pass immigration recheck in and pass back thro immigration it wont Grateful for any advice Cheers MarkOkay so these airline tickets were bought for us by our daughter who booked it all she is now abroad to hard to contact right now we travel to NY on Thurs but our tickets with Norwegian Airlines which our daughter emailed to us show nothing regarding which airport we fly into  pretty important because a relative is picking us up There are no airport codes that I can see Have copied and pasted those details and as you can see it just says New York not JFK or Newark or the codes for said airport have a phone number to ring and will ring that if nobody on here knows Thanks xThis is a terrible fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets If it sounds too good to be true it probably is My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight Weve been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back After looking this company aka Solar Tours Cheapticketabroadcom etc on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed The BBB gives them an F rating Theyve had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company Doesnt get any worse than that Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company Goes to show that if youve never heard of the company and want to purchase online look them up on the Better Business Bureau first That was our biggest mistakeBoth if them are relatively fussy eaters and would prefer a childs meal on the plane  Childs meal is showing in the confirmation for my 12yo but this was confirmed by that travel agent who made the booking for us 10 months ago Now So my question is   I tried ringing them last night but after being in the queue for 30 minutes I abandoned the missionI thought I would share our experience If you have any questions please ask Thomson Flight Booking Easily done online with no problems We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it Seat Selection This was done online as well and it was simple My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldnt let me Online Check in I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes Again simple and easy Night before luggage drop We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems I love being able to do this Flight Boarding was on time and very efficient We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned The flight was comfortable We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan So we did not purchase anything on the plane We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester Luggage  Immigration in Naples we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus At immigration the lines went quickly We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento it took about 1 12 hours The return trip was just as simple and easy On a and  switching airlines forMy vacation destination is up in the air at this point and Im flexible so Id

we had just come through a very trying experience I was in no position to change planes in Kingston I wrote to Air Jamaica and they have never written back Further there is no way to get in touch with

Philadelphia airport as its our first time flying to america new york Ive been checking about time between connecting flights and how far Term A is from Term F etc Reading some of the replies though Ive picked up that some people have said that we need to go through customssecurity and then collect our luggage BUT  Or will we have to collect our luggage when we land at PHL and then check it in again on our connecting flight to LGA Thanks hi allbecause i dont want to pay 17000 to change itCruising the dream Dec 4th 2015Hi allComments would be welcome pleaseI was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta I say surprised because I generally dont fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade Since Im new to doing Mileage Runs I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious  just enough miles to push me over the threshold Ive read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity but I did find an inexpensive RT flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon has a short layover at SDF and then returns to ATL by about 800 PM on the same day It cost about 145 altogether and Ill get 1000 miles out of it  not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile but for a first effort I guess its not too bad plus its a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason Anyway heres my question My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville delays etc and I will miss the return flight to AtlantaBoth flights have the same flight number so I am guessing its the same physical airplane for both legs I figure worst case I can do a oneway car rental and drive home 6 hours if I miss the return but would obviously rather fly note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade so no real harm done if that happens Thats really all I wanted to know I guess I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing but I am not active over there yet My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy so I am just trying to allay some concerns Thanks for any advice you all can offer JimG on any routes I have tried calling the airline and emailing them but received no replyThanking youI am planning on taking thngs to my daughter who is a missionary in Kiev  I emailed NW and they just basically emailed me back copied info from their website that didnt answer my questionI usually fly Zoom these days but have priced fares for April and I refuse to use Air CanadaI have never been to that airport so not sure if we have a far distance to walk to connect or if all Jetblue flights leavefrom the same terminal I really want to book this flight as the other flights have a longer layover and gets us to CR later in the day I would be grateful for any insight or advice on thisI have never been through Istanbuls airportFlying solo Thankschrisbecause i got my ticket from this agencyor I have to go up or down to get the air train thanks ilanaor I should be okAny suggestions Thanks for any helpHi everybody Im really worried becauseJust for a surname The rest is correct Does anyone know a solution Have you been in the same situation any of you Thanks a lotThere are two sections on this plane outfitted with these seats in rows 25 and 10 and 11 the latter two rows being exit rows Only those in row 11 are rated good seats in SeatGuru ie green Those in rows 25 are rated standard white and row 10 has drawbacks yellow  I went ahead and selected a seat a window green seat in row 11 but

same flight 1 SCL to AKL roundtrip 2 AKL to SYD roundtrip Both flights are labeled with the same number LA801 SCLAKLSYD and LA800 SYDAKLSCLRegardsweve always flown economy and there is no chance financially of upgrading to economy plus for the whole trip  I cant see how to do this online so Im not sure if its possibleforgive me if its a stupid question Im just a rookie i hear it can take some time at customs when i look at the flights a lot of them only have like an hour and ten minutes or an hour ans 30 minutes but that seems w way to short  dont know why they sell flight with so little time between flights  Hi all My passport is going to expire in a couple of months andI just need to renew my passport so I’m assuming it’s just the expiry date that I need to update once I’ve got my new passport Just want to get our flights booked very soon since Air Asias cancelled all their ParisLondon routes and were booked with them in May Thanks very much Cheers CocoHi All We fly to cancun

it opens for any combination Thanks DannyhithanksHi ThanksI am travelling from Edinburgh to Newark then onto Toronto ThanksAloha from Kauaiwell almost flatI have checked the Suite Dreams site and it shows 33 of the planes have been changed  has anyone flown this class recently and had the new configuration We were lucky enough last year on one portion of our trip to Paris to have the newly configured seating and it was so nice Im hoping for a miracle that this year we might luck out again Just wondering how likely this is in your opinion Malama Pono JanetHere is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for 843 from Flight Network Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability First it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about even using the flight numbers Then the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code for 20 discount per booking The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers Without asking me for my promo code she has already applied a random promo code that gives 10 discount I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online I hang up with the agent go through the online booking system put in my credit card click on “Purchase Now” only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at 896 I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time and she tells me that flight prices have gone up I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight Another 45 minutes goes by again long hold times and my 3 flights are now booked I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice The next day I notice the flight is showing at 843 again And on top of that when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking the purchase price is actually at 843 So when I call back FlightNetwork I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice Again more ridiculously long hold times  every time I ask a question the agent tells me to hold on puts me on hold for 510 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question Initially the agent tells me that she says I was charged 843 mistakenly I am so confused Then she comes back and says oh no it was 896 that you were charged Complete chaos She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying 285 for the flight and 61157 in taxes totalling 89657 Then I tell her that the flight is back to 843 on their website She says she cannot see this price in their database I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing 843 I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price She then says that because the flight is book she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 35 business days It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see During the call I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour Then I finally see the charge on my credit card  I see 2 charges One with the description AIR CANADA totalling 843 and another with description TASF totalling 53 I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me It is not even detailed in the invoice I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced This is only 53 but the principle of the matter I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card let alone the absolutely horrible service I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act Not worth the headache and lack of transparency Embarrassing that this is a Canadian companyThinking about flying with them for the first time andThanksYour advice would be really appreciatedMy instinct is telling me its possible  there is enough timebut i am just looking for reassuranceWe are also saving 350euro which is almost the cost of our hotel for the week by doing it the long way round What do any of you think  I need to make a decision on this before tomorrowI am looking at flying VA from SFO to BOS in August and their fares arent too bad Thanks for any help you can offerHelloMe and my friend or has any reflections  I was doing some googling and found out that the seats in 10 A B had some metal thing on them iow quite uncomfortable Am afraid its the same with ours thankson their way to Mexico in a few weeks While they are in decent shape the worst case scenario walking distance could be close to a mile They can walk the distance but may be rushed for time The connection is about 45 minutes They are both over 77 and I think the cart is a fair perk for an older traveler I am not sure it is the quickest way through the airport though ThanksHi everyone I am trying to determine if what I am finding is reasonable I know there are different variables that cause fluctuations in airfare but  I am not going until April so I have some time to shop aroundat the momentHi even though the first leg of indirect is the exact same flight as the direct optionTHanksUntil Seatguru catches up with a measure for this attributeThanks My longhaul economy class experience within the last two years Singapore Airlines 777 is terrible A380 is not so bad Nothing else in my experience gets nearly as bad as the SQ 777 Lufthansa A380 Qantas A380 United E any aircraft Swiss A340 EVA 777 Air Canada 787  777 ANA 787 Air Berlin A330 Edited 320 am March 21 2016I have seen several posts in the past asking if this is possible Apparently it now is at least on United Wonder if other airlines will pick this

and I are planning our honeymoon May 2009 and we have a seemingly difficult decision to make  I fear we’re destined to either miss our flight or have our flight cancelled HELPany help would be greatfulJust experienced dreadful return flight from Athens Worst seat Ive ever sat in Etihad operatedVirgin flight number No real allegiance to any airline any moreIm on the phone on hold right now and as is with most of Air Canadas service its been 15 minutes and counting Just thought someone here might knowthanksHiin general many thanksHiOur usual pram we brought on ryanair flight a few weeks ago had to be sent in for repair today and as we are travelling 14 days today we might not get it back in time My spare pram  Silvercross Surf  folds up in 2 parts  the seat unit and then the chassis part  so my question is is this allowed to bring to the gate I have tried reading through the fqas on the ryanair website but this is not clear at allit basically just says one pushchair is allowed per childThey always asks me though when travelling by the check in if i want to bring the pram to the gate and does it collapseReally dont want to end up paying 30 pounds per way if having to check it in which is the cost at the airport for checked in baby equipment and then having to carry my 7 month old baby around for the next 2 hours lol  in that case i rather buy a cheap 2nd hand buggy on a facebook selling group to bring with me as 60 quid return is more than the pram cost me lol  Any help will be much appreciated Then onwards to Heathrow who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dryAfter an hour the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face his was not the end of our troubles This was pointed out to the crew Approaching to land I was told by the leader that they would be waiting for me in the corridor This was heard by a Stewardess A terrifying experience all round Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually Luckily for us they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow The questions is My boyfriend and I made a trip to SpainHong KongMadrid and Madrid Hong Kong We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow Both going30th Aug and coming back15th Sep the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries The going trip to Spain both suitcase locks were open broken lock for my boyfriends case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later However the real disaster was actually the coming back trip When we picked up the luggage we found out that both luggages were broken there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced brokenso my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip I have locked them before checkin and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner That aside when we got home I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed upas messy as a 80 sale basket in the shopping mall the wrapped present was torn open wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage Furthermore my boyfriends mobile phoneold one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China and his suit together with necktie and belt were stolen The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up now Im waiting for the reply email which I dont know whether they will even cared to read Frankly speaking I have no hope that they will contact us back So and choose the airline wisely we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson For us With what had happened we would not hesitate to pay 100200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhereHi I am flying in November from Orlando to Las Vegas with American Airlines Looking over my flights Im not really feeling confident and just wanted to check if I should go ahead with this flight or if I should be contacting American to see about a change That first connection time is very short I am just a bit concerned that myself or my luggage might not make itJust was after an opinion of what people think I should do or if it would be fine  also all the flights are on the same ticket purchased at the same time Thanks Edited 351 am August 04 2016We just signed up for a United Credit Card so that we can build up miles for a trip we are planning All miles on the card will go to my husbands account We both have about 12K miles on our United miles accounts I wanted to transfer mine to his until I learned it would cost me 18000 to do so I was used to Hawaiian Airlines mileage account and this was a free transaction Also by obtaining the United Mileage Explorer credit card the primary person gets priority boarding and 2 checked bags free Their traveling companion will get the same as long as their are on the same reservation So I cant use my miles to get a ticket seperatelly On Hawaiian you dont have to be on the same reservation but just traveling together Some of this doesnt make sense to me so I want to be sure I am understanding this correctly Can anyone point me to a board so I can ask questions by those that may be more knowledgeable Thank youespecially if you connect through Philly  Ill try to keep this brief PhxPHL leg uneventful Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together Got to LHR safely Had great trip Flight backhuge overbook and again asking for volunteers at least no aircraft downgrade Left almost on time not 1 seat to spare Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates I had to reclaim my bag go through security again ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked No clean clothes nothing All toiletries sitting in Phx Got small care package from airline with toothbrush shampoo thats it Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase Lesson learnedpack some clothes and necessties in carryon in case you get stuck and fly non stop if available this was posted weeks ago and is still on there They have now added another entry saying that GB customers will get 1 case up to 20 kilos and both of these conflicting items are still on their website I phoned last Friday and they confirmed the 23 kilos was right I phoned yesterday and they said it was 20 kilos and the lady had to look on line to find out what I ment then she came back to me and said that the 23kilos was a mistake and they would only allow up to 20 kilos When the sale went through and the e mail was sent out they say one thing and as soon as you confirm they move the goal post I told them that it obviously not a mistake but a deliberate change of their mind As our flight going out is still with GB and now coming back with Easyjet with 2 different allowances which is really annoying as they also informed me that one case cannot be 22 kilos and another 18 which is even more annoying I have printed off the website answer to the question which says that GB passengers will not have their baggage allowance changed do you think I have a leg to stand on if I take this to the airport Sorry to go on I have to wonder exactly who ticked the market research box Yes please stop helping me pass the time with films and other entertainment and try to squeeze another £750 out of me instead GeoffI made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest willy nilly although you can bet its the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled Couldnt get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW service was little help Apparently this has been going on frequently yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection If we had been warned earlier in the day we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasnt going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone so we stayed in line and the inperson clerk who was also helping unload planes at the same time was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least its a chance if it all goes well To add insult to this while on hold with NW they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays Oh but then they might lose business better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago Im afraid that Ill be avoiding NW especially their Airlink for at least that many years after this I cant think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling but that was before the hubs maximizing seat capacity disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seatsHiwith no problems Many ThanksI read a lot of bad things for govolo Please does anyone know during the time when confirmation is pending and I have not yet received confirmation and I have not yet paid Thanks a lotI have searched on net and found out some trip advisor forum question as well regarding the same issue but those were for some other carrier and not Indigo So wanted to be sure about Indigo if anyone have first hand experience Name change on ticket is not allowed and cancellation and re booking will cost me at least 5000 INR  Please helpI flew recently with Qatar Airways between Melbourne and Nairobi When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 12 hours Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me All in all my flight from the moment of check in to when I landed was an absolute nightmare Hello long time lurker looking for some adviceeks in August on Air India back in AugustBasically the family member we were planning to visit has now passed away so we are not really able to travel any more at this particular timebut have scoured the bravely website to no avail I cant find a breakdown of the cost of my booking or how much of it is taxes etc I know I can ring them and ask them but Id like to have all the facts to hand before I do so I can see also that a voucher can be offered but even thats not clear as to how it is calculated Not sure how to proceedI can see on here that they seem to have a bad rep thanks in advance valmiki was devastated some so rare items I dare not think about it They actually make money from putting you on hold I found several auction houses in London that sell off lost luggage and kept doing a search for records 4 months later guess what they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find On calling up the auction house they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60 12 million bags were irretrievably lost by BA in 2007 Shocking reallyEnd of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus Brazil It was my first experience with long distance travelling The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookersbe The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal The journey to Manaus was perfect but on my return happened an unexpected problemEven showing my eticket and proof of my payment they refused to let me board It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOLgate witch costed me 78100 euro Arriving at Fortaleza Airport I adressed myself to the TAP office They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint Back home I adressed my complaint first to TAP but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website witch I did without any further respons Since I booked my trip trough Ebookersbe I repeated my complaint to that company also by filling in a form on their customerservice website You receive an automatic answer with a registrationnumber and the promise they would answer within 48 hours 5 days later I still had no answer I send them a reminder but even 2 weeks later there was no further respons I send Ebookers another rather angry mail on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make Now 3 months further I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the unwanted mail or the trash map I dont know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flightHi Having never booked a flight myself before I didnt know that this was actually a very short time in terms of changing flights The two flights are with different airlines Air Berlin and BA but I booked them with triptsa not realising it was a fairly bad site The planes are in different terminals but Im not sure how big the airport is and if this would be possible Any help is really appreciated ThanksIm having a real problem withregarding a prebooked return flight for four people The flights are part of an Easter holiday for the family The email they sent us is from a blind address  you cant reply to it Theres no email address given on their website for problems or complaints Their telephone number does not respond its a recording that that goes through several menus and then ends in a dead line and their fax number comes up on my machine saying cannot transmit to this number Anyone in Australia had this experience found anotherNot only are the flights rarely ontime and you can count on missing your connections BUT they also refuse to provide the passengers with any information whatsoever about what the amount of time the delay will be nor the reasons for the delays They did not provide a meal even when the delay was for three hours and the passengers were kept aboard a plane without water or food Little children were crying saying mommy I am hungry I will never fly on LIAT again and if that means I do not go to St Vincent well I guess I wont be going thereHi i wonder if its normal Its not in my spam Just didnt get one I already paid via paypal Ive contacted the support but didnt get a reply since 2 days Anyone could help me out Is that normalOur flight Myself and my girlfriend number AR7575 from Mendoza to Cordoba at 1925 was cancelled and nobody advises us anticipatively Due to the cancelation we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas from Cordoba to Sao Paulo After 3 hours waiting the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 2306 at 0600 So 11 hours later and from a different place They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo neither a Hotel We paid everything from our own USD 150 from hotels and taxisand went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 2306 at 1755 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets USD 1000 each one We lost meetings and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation Furthermore we have a lot of stress nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo Aerolineas do not do anything to help us For luck we had money to do everything from our own We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spendingNever more we would choose this wretched airlineI’m a current flyer special member from LANTAM and never happens to me Moreover if I wasn’t a special member from TAM I would not arrived in Sao Paulo because there wasn’t available flight for us and Aerolineas did anythingWe flew on Southwest last week Before we left for the airport we checked the flight status and saw that our flight was delayed It showed a new departure time one half hour later than the scheduled time and also showed NTP We took our time getting to the airport When we got to the gate the board showed our flight as delayed with no scheduled time Fifteen minutes before the original departure time they began boarding and the plane left at the scheduled time We were glad that we hadnt dawdled too muchI would like to be able to charge my cell phone  laptop Thank youwhich has had an engaged tone continuously since yesterday afternoonGood grief this is harder than I thought Although I certainly understand Boise or as I call it Spudville is NOT a travel hub of any sort it just shouldnt be this complicated to buy a ticket online without involving a travel agenteven though they are partners with airlines that do fly into BoiseI really dont want to travel on two separate tickets I have also tried Matrixwhich is usually very helpful in finding a good routing and price from Spudville In the past Ive found my itinerary then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe With Bangkok this isnt workingthe fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix and Hello I paid for a return transfer and didnt want to spend time finding an Internet cafe or somewhere with wifi to sort something out that I thought Id be prebooked as I only have a short weekend trip awayplease helpAs soon as the tickets become availableAccording to my research thus far row 49 seats JK 49 HJ had acres of leg room but 49K had virtually no leg room The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency it is worse than the normal seats I complained to the steward who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident Fortunately for us there was noone sitting in seat 49H so we used HJ and had a great flight  but it could have been much worse  there is no reason to charge extra to get LESS legroom RobinWeve been European travelers for more years than I can remember  at least one trip per year or more Weve never used travel insurance because except on one occasion weve always booked our own flights hotels trains etc That said  Ive noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people whove encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies This has gotten me thinking that maybe weve just been lucky all these years Last year we were in the Benelux countries during the volcano eruption Our luck held as the nofly ban was lifted on the day we left in fact our booked tix were on the first UAL flight allowed out of Brussels Sowere heading to the UK in May and we are taking a Rick Steves tour of Rome in October before heading on to other Italian cities Now  Has anyone any recommendations On Rick Steves website hes mentioned about four companies  but is very careful not to recommend a particular one Ive investigated one just to see what the rates are Access America but am wondering if any of you experienced people have any recommendations or cautions to share Thanks for any helpI used them because I currently live in Khartoum and there are not many websites that will service that airport I thought that I had found a really good deal but then when I arrived at the airport at 200 am it was to find that the confirmation that I received was not valid and I was not booked onto any flights When calling them from the airport the curt customer service rep said that there was nothing that they could do and that I had to buy my ticket at the counter After this and many many emails phone calls and credit card forms having to be filled out and faxed in I received an itinerary that was 600 more then originally quoted a flight that was highly inconvenient that added 15 hours onto my trip and basically cut out 2 days of my vacation Stay far away from this companyI wanted to pass on my experience to travelers trying to get a passport in under 3 weeks from travel date I was caught in the Oh s time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency  I scrambled 2 and 12 weeks till travel date what should I do I panicked I read horror stories and read great stories online What should I do I ask my self Wait 12 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it At the time expediated was 23 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark The passport agent told me do it my response was what if I dont get it in time he stated  I had a get out of jail free card At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient It only took 7 days thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 23 week mark and are scared dont be scared  Suggestions dont forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in  Edited 816 pm May 28 2016We recently flew Delta LHRATL in economy and when I checked in it said we could check 2 bags for free each When I look it up on Deltas website it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag deltacomcontent… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person We did pay for Economy Comfort but that doesnt seem to affect what bags you can check The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the For all other international flights at the bottom of the chart Obviously Im not complaining but Id like to understand so I know in the future if we are entitled to 2 bags ThanksHere is the link to the news article timecomtime… They can stuff it If the rich dudes and money heavy government organizations that are proposing this think developing countries need more money then donate more themselves Or ensure that what money gets donated already goes directly to the essential materials and staff for the programs needed and not to corrupt country middlemen or into the pockets of some despot who is more than willing to let aid into their country but only if his pockets gets lined with a percentageHiya as my other half is very fussy with food Thanks Got to say though the most frustrating part of all this is not knowing what was happening From being given a reference number at Barcelona to it being delivered Ive been unable to track it as my number wasnt recognised Ive emailed them with no response at all Have tried ringing and just got an answer machine telling me all lines are busy  to try again later and the most frustrating has been after 5 days trying to complete an online form which then generates a text message directing you to complete the same form Still think Vuelling have major problems but for anyone who is still waiting for delayed baggage hope you get the same outcome as meHi NathGiven that the day the ship returns to port we will also have to fly back homeand asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship distance technical problems etc what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship but who knows I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises  I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service like extra luggage or preferential seating I should pay for but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service it really bothers me In my opinion this is a nickel and dime practice at best I wrote them an email about it and they did NOT even respond to it I would at least expect a typical answer from them Thank you all AndreasFeb 2nd 2008 I was at NewarkLiberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the Airway BillConfirmation number to track as well I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than we dont know where the dog is there were no dogs on flight 558 They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side break room with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the packages were found Disgraceful There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation I called the breeder who could not get any information I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it Not true but this was the only information available Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities The fact that an error was made was not the issue In fact as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight AA systems are dangerously flawed The employees are incompetenent dont care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal child or anything of value These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time neglected by American Airlines They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transportingThey have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them byI flew recently with Qatar Airways between Melbourne and Nairobi When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 12 hours Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me All in all my flight from the moment of check in to when I landed was an absolute nightmare Dear Forum Members or experiences of other

thanks I think he had Cerebral Palsy We were in the row behind and asked whether this was okay to the chief stewardessHer reply was that there were 2 able bodied passengers capable of opening the door

BA6406 operated by Comair Ltd CPTJNB QR1364 JNBDOH QR763 DOHYUL  or do I need to pick it up at JNB and check it in again or do I do that at DOH Thanks in advanceI see that a couple of the big middle eastern airlines do 1 stop services to Tehran with varying levels of inconvenience with their connections What Id prefer to book though is one of the daily flights operated by Mahan Air or depending on whether their winter schedule matches our dates one of Iran Airs flights on the 747SP None of the usual booking engines or sites show the Mahan Air flights and the Mahan website doesnt have a booking portal ThanksHiI got there yesterday but today when I went to see a res I couldnt get to the site at allHello Earlier this evening I am curious if anyone else has experienced this problem when using Safari I searched previous forum posts but didnt see anything mentioned I will most likely attempt to retry the transaction tomorrow on my laptop as opposed to my iPad Thank you Thank in advanceHello we just booked our economy Seat Guru does not have the updated seat map for this plane Would like these seats so nobody will be prodding the touchscreens all the way accross the pond but we be put off them if the seats wont recline Many thanks PaulHello everyone so heres what happened We have a trip scheduled to Madrid for November and we are flying with ryanairThe itinerary is thessalonikimilan milanmadrid and today I know we can get a refund for only one flight the one that has been changed but obviously this is not a solution since we have paid for fourI havent heard of this airline beforeI heard the seats are truly quite hard and uncomfortable This particular route usually flies an The TACA website shows the types of planes they have in their fleet but no detailed seat maps or have any advice on the seats exit rows etc Thanks HershelHi I hope an expert can help me hereI hope you can clarify Thank youHas anyone else had this length of stop over We arrive 730am and depart 1125pm I am travelling with an eleven year old and fourteen year old Thanks I am due to fly to Sharm el sheikh from Dublin on Sunday but cannot get a definitive answer from the Panorama tour operators on whether a replacement aircraft has been made available Would appreciate responses from anyone in a similar situationA question for UK or non EU experts We have booked flights to Spain out from UK with Vueling back with Iberia but did it through a third party site  presumably given by them to the site that booked for me I cannot find a FAQ or email enquiry form to ask anyone directly has anyone any suggestions of what I should do next Many thanks MilissaHi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had prebooked meals for both flights along with exit seats As we are now Coeliacs no Gluten we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging contains gluten so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg  so I requested a refund of the return flights prebooked meals which was some 10 days away This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any Plus Airasia have a no outside food policy I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero so we did bring some snacks The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on So seem to have pressed the mute button on the Michael OSleary remote control Perhaps realising that pi55ing customers off is perhaps not the best business strategy in the world and that the same joke is just not funny year after year Not all publicity is good publicity it appears So they do seem on the face of it to have made some good improvements They have a new marketing manager team and it seems strategy The website has been completely revamped and IMO looks and feels great The stupid CAPTCHA thing has been removed Credit  debit card charges have been reduced to a fair or is that a fare level Reserved seating throughout the aircraft allowing small handbags to be carried in addition to your carry on and an all round hug me I’m from Ryanair feeling telegraphcoukfinancenewsbysectortranspo… So anyone flown them recently and did you see improvements in attitude and service Should I put them on my will fly list againI have read several other posts on here about Allegiant Airlines and Disabled individuals expecting to receive more services than they are actually due because of their disabled status I want to make sure you know Im not one of those peopleThese requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant Instead On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate  I didnt say anything at that time thinking that it was just a things happen situation Then he started telling me how it was normal wear and tear REALLY When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl Its going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it Now though Im house bound because they just didnt care to take care of something that is so important to meSince Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat fresh blankets pillows and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings The entire crew was dressed very sharply smiled and actually thanked us for flying with them They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs Every flight on AA that weve taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crewsit is common place on AA It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable On each leg of the trip our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes Best decision weve made to switch our business to Deltawhich is essentially an encapsulation of a larger more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal While Ive mentioned this before I thought the article was interesting for two reasons First it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality that being the average air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid on average back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation Again this is an average and applies to only US carriers but I do think that it applies to most markets some more than others but most markets But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didnt exist as separate charges back in 1995 the WSJ author quotes a figure of 2166 for these fees in total its STILL cheaper 16 cheaper with the fees added into the comparison 21 without the fees added USA Today …usatodaycomflights…1 Travel SafeHi as my son wears trainers or plimsolls or flip flops for holidays Its really not suitable to wear his leather shoes just to enter the lounge and then be burdened with them all holiday I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode Shouldnt the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainerswhat is the problem Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean tidy and respectful to othersFirst of all  let me say  I know baggage allowances exist for good reason  and that we should abide by them  This post is not about that  its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand I was flying OrkBirmigham on an ATR72 double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space I fly this route relatively often  and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold Also  as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked  but they are as its a pretty full flight Cest la Vie The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft which is a BS excuse really   a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags  Cest la vie On my return leg  I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag  I get advised that if I do there will be a charge at least 50 of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it  which of course is free  but I prefer not having to check it I inform the staff member Ms Ragdish that i have no desire to check it but will it be taken off me She asks me to present it for weighing  and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late Michael OLeary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions  and moved away from it in favour of better customer services Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus  If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy soap box dismantledHi My daughter and I will have a 14 hour stopover from 2020 on Sunday 7th August to 1050 on Monday 8th August Seems a very long time to be doing nothing ThanksHiI applied for my first adult passport in July2014 by using the online form available Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form this time in paper form I contacted HMPO and asked why since my application was complete and with no errors They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 details on parents I went back into the online form this time taking screen shots with date and time and surprise surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form screen to complete payment and submit I tried contacting them by phone but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again I tried complaining had no replies Phoned again several times then they finally said they could not find my application then later on they found it but that there was no way around it As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now  and still no idea when it will be finalised I read in a similar trip advisor forum Problems with the Passport Officedated April 2014 that some people Miss B and Nanny503927 for example were having similar problems I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues Thank youBought tickets on Expedia for RT Albuquerque t o Cairo via Turksih Air for our family Turkish Air flight was late leaving JFK We would miss our connection to Cairo so they rebooked us on Egypt Air much better airline than Turkish Air On our return flight which we bought tickets for and paid for and reserved seat assignments frequent flyers miles numbers special meals we discovered Turkish Air resold our seats and I guess cancelled the reservation The result was the absolute worst seats in the back of the plane not sitting together as a family even though we were travelling with a child Also we apparently dont get frequent flyer partner miles with this airline either even though the Turkish Air agent on the phone and the ones in the airport assured us we would Much better everythingcustomer service flight attendants food AND they are on time or actually leave early if everyone is checked in Never ever fly Turkish Air TerribleTheir website isnt much helpIll always remember when we went to China back in 2008 the weather in August was too hot for me but the country was fascinating and the Eclipse was fantastic  aerialsandtvcom…ChinaEclipse Unfortunately BOTH our suitcase failed on the same trip  And significantly the zips went on both of them So we needed new cases we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain and most importantly no zips And we found them  American Tourister Flite Samsonites budget range Theyre not the lightest in the world but built like tanks plastic tanks I grant you but tanks none the less Youll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels They came with a 3 year guarantee but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one it just screwed on and they just put it in the post for free  That level of customer service is rare indeed these days Anyway earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy Ive seldom been so certain of any recommendation buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009 but guess what  Yes youre right  They dont do them anymore  In fact they dont do anything similar and neither does anyone else well Samsonite do one model but that was a bit out of her price range The question is  Edited 415 pm September 20 2012I am flying from Johannesburg to Moscow with Swiss Air in September this year I have a stopover in

answered beforeor the answer is staring me in the face on the BA home page Any help gratefully acceptedWe traveled as a family of 12 6 children and 6 adults in Executive Class from JFKDEL in December 2008 and returned from BLRBOMEWR Via Heathrow in January 2009 also Executive The inflight service on the flight from JFK 772200LR was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping The airlines grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group There were no PreBoarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service but nonexistent entertainment and the seats were not flat The transit at Heathrow a refueling and more passengers stop was the most miserable experience in all our flying years Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow

not having to worry about themI understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didnt open until midday we couldnt get in to NY for the day which was our intention However that is hardly Silverjets fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable with plenty of food and drinks should one need it All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other wayVirgin and Sinapore have we sites which show you the actual seats and how they are laid out I dont want to be looking at someone across the isle from me and would prefer sitting side by side with my husband although I know with flat beds this is not usually the case Any ideas as to sites I can visitAs with many worried about the implications of Mexicanas potential bankruptcyshutdownSo far the flight is not suspendedcancelledreduced like many othersWere thinking of winging it and relying on expedia to rebook us if there is a cancellation or the airline stops operating Any thoughts on consequences We found out that they charge 500 if we do miss the flight and have to book a late oneouch Thanks in advance for any repliesOTB charged us £532 for the return flights They paid Thomas Cook £420 for the same The baggage charge was £19 each per journey Total £72 They paid Thomas Cook £38 in total In total there was an increaseunearned profit of almost 30  The moral  never ever use On The Beach  not only that they never pick up the phone nor do they give you an email addressHi Despite all the negative feedback on the I decided it was worth trying to acquire one as I travel with Ryanair frequentlyI flew with Canjet to St Lucia December 2010 Christmas Holiday The temperature was very freezing that I and many passengers had to keep our winter coats on at all times The flight crews would not do anything about it As I catches cold easily I was worried about my health and so are many other passengers that flew with me I am a world travellerdespite the very high altitude at a comfortable level The Management even support each other I and I am sure other passengers as well had a very uncomfortable flight to St Lucia Please do not give anymore businesses to CanjetHi Was the first time flying with this airline  you could tell that they enjoyed their jobs They were quite comical The flights departed on time and actually got into both New York and Toronto 30 minutes early I would fly WestJet againI have a friend who has cut up ALL his Credit Cards because he was always getting into problems with to much spending He is always asked for a Credit Card There is a fee for booking with a Travel Agent or at the Airport and I appreciate any comments or info you may have ThanksHave they improved I would say yes  Obviously you dont expect or get full service on a short island hop but its quite adequate There may be something in the WI culture or LIAT training which doesnt generate an instant but synthetic have a nice day welcome but if you engage with the staff my experience was that you receive a warm  informed responseHello I am sorry for posting this in the air travel forum but I have spent literally weeks trying to research this calling everybody I can think of only to be told to contact my embassy who does not take phone calls or give any adviceI cant risk being denied and losing all the money I spent Please reply as I am due to travel very soon Thank youtessyHi everyone I know this question is noting to do with Cyprus but as your normally all so helpfull thought you might know not the toilet side the galley side and wondered if these were ok all legroom ones have gone so thought this might give us slightly more legroom any views We dont normally prebook but after last year not sitting together we are this year Thanks in advanceHi LouShe will be taking hold luggage and a small backpack as cabin baggage She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end The baby is already very heavy and although can walk a bit will not be able to walk long distances She is too heavy Has anyone else had this problem I was thinking of her using special assistance but that really for disabled passengers Any other ideas would be gratefully receivedhiim a teacher so need to go during summer holidays so expect it to be more expensive but at the minute the prices are sky high is there likely to be a jan sale or what is peoples advice for me in relation to flights we simply couldnt afford to go at the current prices has to be flight only as we already have accomodation over there my mum is in the disney vacation club thanks in advanceMade a telephone booking on Mon10th Sept for flights to Auckland for 2 and up to now have not received my e tickets Have made several calls and sent emails last one made at 1300 today received a reply informing me  should get tickets today by 6 pm Starting to feel unnerved any stories out thereup a journey for me should I need it which I dont With the others that would be extra And BA includes two items of hand luggage Moral of story check before you blindly book with a Low Cost CarrierHelloThey are only up until the end of July 2010 at the mo and I cant wait to book Thanks  I think they are trying to go for a recordt is an incredible deal but before I shell out any funds to them Thanks I will be on my own and a bit nervous about the change ThankshttpnytimsICNGGqj I hope link works IMO it is going to take more than redesign to help both airportsthere has to be major infrastructure overhaul including better road access and subway access And then theres the Port Authority of NYNJ which is a whole other topic I always try to fly into EWR if possible when going to New YorkI booked a flight to a Central American destination early this year for a nice midwinter vacation with my husband Well the day of our flight there was a major North Eastern snowstorm Not my fault Not Aeromexicos fault These things happen So I called them to see how they were going to handle it They said a refund was not an option Fine Act of God whatever So oh by the waywhich was 500 more than the original ticket price because the only tickets they had available were during the high season I think thats poor customer service but okay Fine The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it Well I called back three weeks later to rebook it and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight that time had passed they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor The guy on the phone was extremely rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor At which time he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes Finally I hung up and called back The same jerk answered the phone I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again and he hung up on me What The hell Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason If there is any problem at all even if its not your fault youre not going to get your money back no matter what you do Im out 1200 unless my bank agrees to reverse the charges Edited 207 am March 11 2014I have read postings about how airlines do not accept miles all the time We are looking for an airline with a credit card that makes it easy to book a flight with miles Any suggestionsThanksHello everyone  Thanks for your help Can anyone advise me on or anal I take 10 tablets a day X 87 days  This is a lot of tablets in 30 boxes  Will they allow me to repackage into slighly larger packages or perhaps just putting all the foil packets into one plastic bag I have all the prescriptions and doctors letters to go with the medications I reckon they would half fill a carry on bag  We will be travelling through Asia USA and Pacific regionsI guess thats the only way to do it given that it is not actually in the airport businesstravellercomnewslondoncityopens…Australian companies seen to like acronyms Another one is their energy company Santos and while it might mean saints is at least one language it is an acronym for South Australia and Northern Territory Oil Search So why am I starting this thread I need to be able to reference a thread in order to create a Top Question  Feel free to list other commonly misspelled airline namesHi ie mignight of the 14 days before the time of flight etc thanksthe last time I travelled you could have 2 suitcases each now I know the rules have changed Thank youSent them a copy of my bank statement showing payment was made and have the stamp mark in my passport but Hello fellow travelers I am wondering  since Im still doing research on the country Im visiting next year when will the airfare be available Eg Its too early at the moment since the only airfare available is up till Feb 2014Has anyone ever had problems over ID have put a new route on their website which will become the longest on their networkThis route would probably be about 5 and a half hours flying time each way and would take up close to 12 hours for an aircraft to complete a round trip Seems an awfully long route is it really going to happen Would be great if it worked out for them It may mean flights as far as northeastern Africa Egypt sort of area and the Middle East or even the Cape Verde Islands from the UK may become viable Would be great if Ryanair could offer thatI have bought a plane ticket from JAL which is a ticket from kuala lumpur malaysia to japan haneda However i need to fly from kuala lumpur to singapore and the plane is operated by malaysia airlines and from singapore to japan where the plane is operated by JALThe ticket is bought from JAL website which consist of these two flightsI cannot recommend this company enoughand has been an absolute diamond in all our dealings If you are sending your elderly mum somewhere in the world then you must contact this guy Once again truely excellent service a rare thing in this day and ageHey everyone I was thinking abt Chicago or Bostonhii am looking for no parking will be needed etc we are not looking for any where flash just somewhere to lay our head any suggestions would be welcome and appreciated the ones that i have been looking at so far are the ibis holiday inn and novotel has any one stayed in themWere going on a Carnival Cruise in June 2007 and want to find the best deal on airfare ThanksThe fares are pretty high right now I know there are no guarantees that the fares will come down but I would really appreciate any advise on this Thank youWe have flight from paris this sunday Had experience with ryanair we were charged 45 euro per person for check in through counterHi Given the possibility of extra security checks on US flights does the following connection time seem too tight as the travel agent thinks it is ok but I have my doubts  I think this connection is too tight but any advice especially from anyone who has travelled to the States from LHR recently would be welcomeHi Ive read some horror stories about them but have heard that they have improved and now have newer planes Id like to hear of experiences and thoughts on them ThanksI had the original eticket from my email inbox but no other information ie boarding passes etc so if you do decide to try and claim this should be the only thing you need to attach to the letter Also they did send me an email with an offer of a voucher to be redeemed on a future Thomas cook holiday expires in 12 months but as I am unable to do that I have asked them to send me a cheque which you are legally entitled to do From sending the letter to receiving the email today it only took 13 days for a resolution Good luck if you decide to go for it PS231 KBP1100 – 1420JFK 763 25 PS232 JFK0030 – 1720KBP 767 36 Service

bagthe airline will try to get you in some way I thought somebody posted another number some time ago but Ive searched and cant find anythinghas a flight that suits us timewise but travels Question I was on a Lufthansa flight between Munich and JFK last week There were a total of five 5 babies in the bulkhead row in front of my husband and me The crying and screaming of so many babies setting each other off led to those paying passengers around them getting less service from the staff while they concentrated their attention on the young children Surely  through a miserable flight Candace Kahn San Francisco Wed like to be able to take advantage of using a credit card to accumulate miles to offset our air travel costs Were sure there are many experienced travelers out there who can lend a hand thanks in advance for your help GeeIf so can you review the experience I paid 200 extra for each seat Clt to Munich but had to pay 500 extra for each seat on the way home from Munich to Charlotte
